When the product is in a refrigerator, remove both vials of ADVATE powder and solvent from the refrigerator and allow to heat to room temperature (between 15 and 25<unk> C).
Since reproduction studies in animals cannot always be transmitted to humans, and due to the vasoconstrictory characteristics of pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.

The main effect of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and to regulate serum calcium, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were investigated in two phase III studies of identical design (n/ 944) and in the Fracture Intervention Study (FIT: n/ 6,459).
However, rare cases of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, some severe even 15, have been reported and frequently occurred in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (e. g. hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption) (see section 4.8).

It inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, cells involved in bone tissue breakdown. By blocking the activity of these cells, alendronate slows bone loss. Vitamin D3 is a nutrient found in some foods but also produced in the skin when exposed to natural sunlight. Vitamin D3, like other forms of vitamin D, is necessary for calcium uptake and normal bone formation. As osteoporosis patients may not produce enough vitamin D3 from exposure to the sun, this vitamin is included in ADROVANCE.

Desloratadine is released from its layer immediately after administration, while pseudoephedrine is slowly released for 12 hours. Therefore, the tablet has to be taken only twice daily.
Therefore, in a main study of 111 patients with haemophilia A, Advate was compared to Recombinate to show that both medicinal products are equivalent. In addition, in 107 patients who received all of Advate, the number of bleeding episodes and the efficacy of Advate in haemostasis was evaluated on a scale from ineffective to excellent. Three additional trials in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a trial of 53 children under six years of age, investigated the use of the blood prevention and surgery medicinal product.
trials with ADROVANCE The effect of the lower dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronate/ 2,800 IU of vitamin D3) on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15 week, multinational trial in 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis (mean serum baseline of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D: 56 nmol/ l <unk> 22.3 ng/ ml <unk>; range: 22.5 -225 nmol/ l <unk> 9 -90 ng/ ml <unk>).

The most frequent adverse reactions (observed in 1 to 10 in 100 patients) are headache, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and digestive system symptoms such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (indigestion), constipation, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (flatulence), ulcers (oesophagus), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), bloated abdomen (bloated abdomen) and acid belching.
Nor should Aerinaze be used in patients with narrow angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), urinary retention (difficult urination), cardiovascular disorders including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (thyroid hypersecretion), or who have had a haemorrhagic stroke (stroke caused by cerebral haemorrhage) or are at risk of a haemorrhagic stroke.
The most frequent adverse reactions with Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 in 100 patients) are tachycardia (racing), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), pharyngitis (pharyngitis), anorexia (anorexia), constipation, headache, tiredness, insomnia, somnolence (somnolence), trouble sleeping and nervousness.
