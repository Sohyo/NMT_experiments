Adenuric is a medicinal product containing the active substance Febuxostat.
It is available as yellow capsule tablets (80 and 120 mg).
Adenuric is used to treat chronic (long-term) hyperuricaemia (high levels of uric acid and urate in the blood).
In hyperuricaemia, urate crystals can form and accumulate in joints and kidneys.
When such deposits form in the joints and cause pain, it is called gout.
Adenuric is used in patients who already show signs of crystal deposits, including arthritis (pain and inflammation in the joints) or rheumatoid nodes (stones i. e. larger urine crystal deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage).
This medicinal product is only available on a doctor's prescription.
The recommended dose of Adenuric is 80 mg once daily.
It can be taken with or without meals.
Adenuric usually lowers the uric acid level in the blood within two weeks. If the uric acid level is still above 6 mg per deciliter after two to four weeks, the dose can be increased to 120 mg once daily.
Attacks of gout can still occur during the first few months of treatment, and it is therefore recommended that patients take other medicines to prevent gout attacks during at least the first six months of treatment with Adenuric.
Treatment with Adenuric should not be discontinued if an attack of gout occurs.
The efficacy and safety of Adenuric have not been evaluated in patients with severe renal or liver problems.
The product is not recommended in paediatric and organ transplant patients as it has not been studied for these groups.
The active substance Feboxustat in Adenuric decreases the formation of uric acid.
It works by inhibiting an enzyme called xanthine oxidase, which is necessary for uric acid production in the body.
By decreasing uric acid production, Adenuric can stimulate

<unk> Adenuric acid levels in the blood and maintain them at a lower level, preventing the formation of crystals, thereby relieving symptoms of gout. If the uric acid level is maintained at a low level long enough, even existing gout nodes may become smaller. How was Adenuric investigated?
The effects of Adenuric were initially tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The efficacy of Adenuric was investigated in two main studies involving a total of 1 834 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout.
The first trial, involving 1 072 patients, compared the efficacy of three different adenuric doses (80, 120 and 240 mg once daily) with placebo (sham) and allopurinol (another medicine used to treat hyperuricaemia).
The second study compared two doses of Adenuric (80 and 120 mg once daily) for one year in 762 patients, each with allopurinol.
In both trials, 300 mg of allopurinol was administered once daily; patients with renal problems received only 100 mg per day.
The main measure of efficacy was the number of patients whose blood uric acid levels were below 6 mg/ dl in the last three measurements.
The level of uric acid in the blood was determined each month.
What benefit has Adenuric shown in these trials?
Adenuric acid was more effective than allopurinol and placebo in lowering uric acid levels in the blood.
In the first trial, 48% (126 out of 262) of those taking 80 mg once daily of Adenuric and 65% (175 out of 269) of those taking 120 mg once daily had uric acid levels below 6 mg/ dl in the last three measurements.
This compared with 22% (60 out of 268) of those receiving allopurinol and none of the 134 receiving placebo.
The second study yielded similar results after one year.
The most common adverse reactions of Adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, diarrhoea, nausea, rash and abnormal liver enzymes.
Particularly in patients with a history of heart problems, there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels.
See the Package Leaflet for a full list of reported Adenuric adverse reactions.
Adenuric should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Feboxustat or any of the ingredients.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that while Adenuric was more effective at lowering uric acid levels in the blood than allopurinol, it could also increase the risk of heart and vascular adverse reactions.
The Committee concluded that the benefits of Adenuric in the treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia when uranium deposits have already occurred outweigh the risks and recommended authorisation for the placing on the market of Adenuric.
On 21 April 2008, the European Commission authorised Adenuric to be marketed throughout the European Union.
The holder of the marketing authorisation is Beaufour Ipsen Pharma.

ADROVANCE is a white capsule tablet containing two active ingredients: sodium alendronate 3 H2O (70 mg) and colecalciferol (vitamin D3, 70 micrograms equivalent to 2800 international units IU).
This medicinal product is identical to FOSAVANCE, which is already authorised in the European Union.
The manufacturer of FOSAVANCE has agreed that the scientific data of this product may also be used for ADROVANCE.
ADROVANCE is used to treat osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become fragile) in post-menopausal women who are at risk for low vitamin D levels.
ADROVANCE reduces the risk of spinal and hip fractures (fractures).
This medicinal product is only available on a doctor's prescription.
The recommended dose is one tablet once a week.
The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicinal products (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).
In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient should not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should be 30 minutes after taking the tablet at the earliest.
The tablet should not be chewed or dissolved in the mouth.
Patients should also take additional calcium if food intake is insufficient.
For more information see the Package Leaflet.
Bone tissue is a living tissue that is continually renewed by degrading old bone tissue and replacing it with new.
Osteoporosis is a disease in which the bones gradually become thin and fragile, resulting in increased susceptibility to fractures (fractures).
This occurs when not enough new bone tissue grows to replace the naturally broken down bone.
Osteoporosis mainly occurs in post-menopausal women (after the 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

The active ingredients in ADROVANCE are alendronate and vitamin D3.
Alendronate is a biphosphonate that has been used to treat osteoporosis since the mid 1990s.
It inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, i. e. cells involved in the breakdown of bone tissue. By blocking the activity of these cells, alendronate slows bone loss. Vitamin D3 is a nutrient found in some foods, but is also produced in the skin when exposed to natural sunlight. Vitamin D3, like other forms of vitamin D, is necessary for calcium uptake and normal bone formation. As patients with osteoporosis may not produce enough vitamin D3 from exposure to the sun, the vitamin is included in ADROVANCE.
Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicinal products authorised in the European Union, the company presented data from previous studies and published literature.
The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE in increasing vitamin D levels.
Patients received either ADROVANCE or alendronate once a week.
The main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of patients with low vitamin D levels.
What benefit has ADROVANCE shown in these studies?
After 15 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D was lower (11%) in those receiving ADROVANCE than in those taking alendronate alone (32%).
The company also presented data showing that the alendronate dose in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.
The most common adverse reactions (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and digestive symptoms such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (indigestion), constipation, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (flatulence), ulcers (ulcers) of the oesophagus, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), distended abdomen (bloated abdomen) and acid regurgitation.
See the Package Leaflet for a full list of reported adverse reactions associated with ADROVANCE.
ADROVANCE should not be used in patients with possible hypersensitivity (allergy) to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients.
It should not be used in esophageal disorders, in patients with hypocalcaemia (low calcium levels), or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that the benefits of ADROVANCE in the treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal patients at risk of vitamin D deficiency outweigh the risks and recommended authorisation for the marketing of ADROVANCE.
On 4 January 2007, the European Commission authorised Merck Sharp <unk> Dohme Ltd to market ADROVANCE throughout the European Union.
The full EPAR for ADROVANCE is available here.
Each tablet contains 70 mg alendronic acid as sodium alendronate 3 H2O and 70 micrograms (2,800 IU) colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Each tablet contains 62 mg lactose and 8 mg sucrose.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Capsule-shaped, white to broken white tablets marked with the outline of a bone on one side and 710 on the other.
Treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in patients at risk for vitamin D deficiency.
ADROVANCE reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.
The recommended dosage is one ADROVANCE tablet weekly.
In view of the course of osteoporosis, ADROVANCE is intended for long-term therapy.
Notes to ensure adequate absorption of alendronate:
ADROVANCE should only be taken with water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before your first meal, drink or take medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.
Other beverages (including mineral water), food and some medicinal products may affect the absorption of alendronate (see section 4.5).
The following instructions should be followed closely in order to reduce the risk of oesophageal irritation and associated side effects (see section 4.4):
ADROVANCE should only be swallowed with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after waking up. Patients should not chew the tablet or allow the tablet to melt in their mouth as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcers. Patients should not lie down before the first food intake of the day, which should not occur before 30 minutes after taking the tablet.
2 Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking ADROVANCE. ADROVANCE should not be taken before bedtime or the first rise of the day.
Patients should be supplemented with calcium if food is not sufficient (see section 4.4).
An additional supplement with vitamin D should be considered individually, taking into account vitamin D uptake by vitamin supplements and supplements.
The equivalent of taking 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 once a week in ADROVANCE and 400 IU of vitamin D once a day was not investigated.
In clinical trials, there was no age-related difference in the efficacy or safety profile of alendronate.
Dose adjustment is therefore not necessary in the elderly.
In patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 35 ml/ min, a dose adjustment is not necessary.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for patients with impaired renal function with GFR below 35 ml/ min due to lack of experience.
ADROVANCE has not been studied in children and adolescents and should therefore not be used in them.
Hypersensitivity to any active substance or ingredients. Oesophagus disorders and other factors that delay oesophageal emptying, such as stricture or achalasia. Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes. Hypocalcaemia.
Alendronate Alendronate can cause local irritation of the mucosae of the upper gastrointestinal tract.
Due to the possible worsening of the underlying disease, alendronate should only be given with special caution in patients with active gastrointestinal disorders such as dysphagia, oesophagus disorders, gastritis, duodenitis, ulcers, or with recent (within the last year), severe gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or upper gastrointestinal surgery except pyloroplasty (see section 4.3).
Oesophageal reactions such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosion, rarely followed by oesophageal stricture, were reported in patients taking alendronate (some of these were severe and required hospitalization).
The doctor should therefore pay close attention to all signs and symptoms indicating possible oesophageal reactions and patients should be advised to discontinue and seek medical advice if symptoms of oesophageal irritation such as dysphagia, swallowing pain or retrostar pain or new or worsening heartburn occur (see section 4.8).
3 The risk of severe oesophageal adverse reactions appears to be increased in patients who are not taking the medicinal product correctly and/ or who continue to take it after symptoms indicating oesophageal irritation occur.
It is very important that all dosage instructions are communicated to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).
Patients should be informed that the risk of oesophageal problems may be increased if they do not follow these instructions.
While large-scale clinical trials of alendronate have not shown an increased risk, gastric and duodenal ulcers, some severe and with complications, have rarely been reported (see section 4.8).
Osteonecrosis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose regimens primarily contain intravenous bisphosphonates.
Many of these patients also received chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has also been reported in osteoporosis patients receiving oral bisphosphonates.
A dental examination with appropriate preventive measures should be preceded by treatment with bisphosphonates if patients exhibit corresponding risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, periodontitis).
During treatment, these patients should avoid maxillofacial surgery as much as possible.
If patients develop osteonecrosis of the jaw during bisphosphonate therapy, maxillofacial surgery may result in aggravation.
There is no data to indicate whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy in patients requiring maxillofacial surgery reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
The clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning for each patient on the basis of an individual benefit-risk-assessment.
Bone, joint and muscle pain have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates.
These symptoms were seldom severe and/ or associated with impairment of mobility (see section 4.8).
The onset of these symptoms varied from one day to several months after initiation of therapy.
In most patients, discomfort decreased after discontinuation of therapy.
In some patients, symptoms recurred when therapy with the same product or another bisphosphonate was resumed.
Patients should be advised that if they fail to take a dose of ADROVANCE, they should take the tablet the next morning after noticing their failure.
You should not take two tablets on the same day, but should continue taking one tablet per week on the designated day of the week as originally planned.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for renal failure patients with GFR below 35 ml/ min (see section 4.2).
Other possible causes of osteoporosis besides oestrogen deficiency and age should be considered.
<unk> Existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected before starting therapy with ADROVANCE (see section 4.3).
Other disorders that impair mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with ADROVANCE.
The vitamin D content of ADROVANCE is not suitable for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency.
In patients with these disorders serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcaemia should be monitored under ADROVANCE therapy.
4 Due to stimulation of bone mineralisation by alendronate, decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur.
However, rare cases of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, some severe, were reported, often in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (e. g. hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption) (see section 4.8).
Colecalciferol Vitamin D3 may increase the severity of hypercalcaemia and/ or hypercalciuria when administered to patients with disorders associated with uncontrolled overproduction of calcitriol (e. g. leukaemia, lymphoma, sarcoidosis).
In these patients urine and serum calcium should be monitored.
Patients with malabsorption may not take sufficient vitamin D3.
Other ingredients This medicinal product contains lactose and sucrose.
This medicinal product should not be used by patients with rare hereditary fructose intolerance, galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and forms of interaction
Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.
Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking other medicinal products (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
No other clinically relevant interactions with medicinal products are expected.
In clinical trials, several patients received oestrogen (intravaginal, transdermal or oral) together with alendronate.
No adverse reactions resulting from this combined use were observed.
Although no specific interaction studies have been conducted, alendronate has been used in clinical trials alongside a wide range of commonly prescribed medicinal products without clinically relevant interactions.
Cholestyramine, colestipol) may impair the absorption of vitamin D.
Anticonvulsants, cimetidine and thiazides can increase the metabolism of vitamin D.
Additional supplementation with vitamin D should be considered individually.
ADROVANCE is designed only for use in post-menopausal women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or by nursing women.
There are no adequate data on the use of ADROVANCE in pregnant women.
Animal studies of alendronate show no evidence of directly damaging effects on pregnancy, foetal or postnatal development.
Alendronate given to pregnant rats caused dystocia associated with hypocalcaemia (see section 5.3).
Animal studies have shown hypercalcaemia and reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3) at high doses.
5 It is not known whether alendronate is absorbed into breast milk.
Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites are absorbed into breast milk.

Rare: severe musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain (see section 4.4).
Rare: symptomatic hypocalcaemia, usually in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (see section 4.4).
Rare: transient symptoms of acute phase reaction (myalgia, discomfort and rare fever), usually at the start of therapy.
Following reactions have been reported (frequency unknown):
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates; most reports have been from cancer patients, but osteoporosis patients have also been reported.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw is usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis).
Cancer diagnosis, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also considered risk factors (see section 4.4).
Laboratory values In clinical trials, asymptomatic, mild and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18% and 10% respectively of those taking alendronate 10 mg/ day, compared with approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo.
However, decreases in serum calcium to <unk> 8.0 mg/ dl (2.0 mmol/ l) and in serum phosphate to 2.0 mg/ dl (0.65 mmol/ l) occurred with a similar frequency in both treatment groups.
Alendronate Oral overdose may result in hypocalcaemia, hypophosphatemia and upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as upset stomach, heartburn, oesophagitis, gastritis or ulcers.
There is no specific experience in treating an overdose with alendronate.
In case of an overdose with ADROVANCE, milk or antacids should be given to bind alendronate.

Vitamin D3 for up to 5 months is not associated with hypercalciuria or hypercalcaemia.
ADROVANCE is a combination tablet with the active ingredients sodium alendronate 3 H2O and colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Alendronate Sodium alendronate 3 H2O is a bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts without exerting a direct effect on bone formation.
Preclinical studies have shown that alendronate is preferred at sites of active absorption
7. The activity of osteoclasts is inhibited, but recruitment and binding of osteoclasts is not affected.
The bone formed under alendronate therapy is of normal quality.
Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol into vitamin D3.
In cases of insufficient exposure to the sun, it is essential that vitamin D3 is a component of food.
Vitamin D3 is converted into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the liver and stored until it is needed.
The conversion to the active calcium mobilising hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) in the kidney is strictly regulated.
The main effect of 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and to regulate serum calcium, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.
Vitamin D3 is necessary for normal bone formation.
A vitamin D deficiency occurs when exposure to the sun and food intake are insufficient.
Deficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, bone loss and an increased risk of skeletal fractures.
In severe cases, deficiency may lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphataemia, weakness of proximal muscles and osteomalacia and thus a further increased risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic subjects.
Supplementation with vitamin D lowers these risks and their consequences.
Bone mineral density) in the spine or hip, which is 2.5 standard deviations below the mean for a normal, young population, or regardless of bone density as a pathological fracture.
<unk> studies with ADROVANCE The effect of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronate/ 2,800 IU of vitamin D3) on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15-week multinational trial in 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis (mean baseline of 25-hydroxyvitamin D: 56 nmol/ l <unk> 22.3 ng/ ml; range: 22.5 -225 nmol/ l <unk> 9-90 ng/ ml <unk>).
Patients received ADROVANCE in the lower dose (70 mg <unk> 2,800 IU) (n<unk> 350) or FOSAMAX (alendronate) 70 mg once weekly (n<unk> 332) and no other vitamin D supplements.
After 15 weeks of treatment, mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher (26%) in the ADROVANCE group (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (56 nmol/ l <unk> 23 ng/ ml <unk>) than in the alendronate group alone (46 nmol/ l <unk> 18.2 ng/ ml <unk>).
ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) significantly decreased the proportion of patients with vitamin D insufficiency (serum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <unk> 37.5 nmol/ l <unk> <unk> 15 ng/ ml <unk>) by 62.5% compared to alendronate alone (12% vs.
32%).
ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <unk> 22.5 nmol/ l <unk> <unk> 9 ng/ ml <unk>) by 92% compared to alendronate alone (1% vs. 13%).
In this study, after 15 weeks, mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in vitamin D deficient patients at baseline (25-hydroxyvitamin D 22.5 to 37.5 nmol/ l <unk> 9 - <unk> 15 ng/ ml <unk>) increased from 30 nmol/ l (12.1 ng/ ml) to 40 nmol/ l (15.9 ng/ ml) in the ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n<unk> 75) group and decreased from 30 nmol/ l (12.0 ng/ ml) at baseline to 26 nmol/ l (10.4 ng/ ml) in the alendronate alone group (n<unk> 70).
There were no differences between the treatment groups with regard to the mean values of serum calcium, phosphate or calcium in 24-hour urine.
Studies of alendronate The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate given weekly 70 mg (n<unk> 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n<unk> 370) was established in a one-year multicenter trial in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.
After one year, increases over baseline lumbar BMD were 5.1% (95% CI:
4.8, 5.4%) in the 70 mg weekly and 5.4% (95% CI:
5.0, 5.8%) in the 10 mg daily group.
The mean BMD increases were 2.3% and 2.9% respectively at the femoral neck and 2.9% and 3.1% at the total hip in the 70 mg weekly and 10 mg daily respectively.
8 treatment groups were also comparable in BMD increases at other skeletal sites.
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were investigated in two Phase II studies of identical design (n<unk> 944) and in the Fracture Intervention (FIT: n<unk> 6,459).
In the Phase IIII trials, mean increases in BMD with alendronate were 10 mg/ day versus placebo at 3 years 8.8% in the spine, 5.9% in the femoral neck and 7.8% in the trochanter.
The BMD of the total skeleton also increased significantly.
In the alendronate treated group, a 48% reduction (alendronate 3.2% vs. placebo 6.2%) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more vertebral fractures.
In the 2 -year extension of these studies, increases in BMD of the spine and trochanter were sustained, and BMD of the femoral neck and entire body was maintained.
FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled trials in which alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and subsequently 10 mg daily for either 1 or 2 years):
FIT 1: a three year trial involving 2,027 patients with at least one pre-existing vertebral <unk> <unk> compression <unk> fracture.
In this study, daily administration of alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% vs. placebo 15.0%).
In addition, a significant reduction in the incidence of hip fractures (1.1% vs. 2.2%; reduction of 51%) was observed.
FIT 2: a four year trial involving 4,432 patients with low bone mass but without pre-existing vertebral fracture.
In this study, a significant difference in the incidence of hip fractures (alendronate 1.0% vs. placebo 2.2%; reduction of 56%) and in the incidence of at least one vertebral fracture (2.9% vs. 5.8%; reduction of 50%) was observed in the analysis of the subgroup of osteoporotic women (37% of the total number who suffered from osteoporosis as defined above).
<unk> Absorption Mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nocturnal fasting and 2 hours prior to eating a standardized breakfast.
Bioavailability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% when alendronate was taken one or half an hour prior to a standardized breakfast.
In osteoporosis studies, alendronate was effective if taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.
The alendronate component of the ADROVANCE combination tablet (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) and the 70 mg alendronate tablet are bioequivalent.
Bioavailability was minimal when alendronate was used with or up to two hours after a standardized breakfast.
Taking alendronate together with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by about 60%.
In healthy subjects the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg 3 times daily for five days) did not result in a clinically important change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the mean range of 20% to 44%).
9 Distribution Studies in rats have shown that after intravenous administration of 1 mg/ kg alendronate transiently disperses into soft tissue, but is then rapidly redistributed into bone or excreted with urine.
The mean steady-state volume of the distribution is at least 28 litres in humans, excluding bone.
Plasma concentrations after oral therapeutic doses of alendronate are too low for analytical detection (<unk> 5 ng/ ml).
<unk> protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78 <unk>.
Biotransformation There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolised in animals or humans.
Excretion Following the intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactively labelled substance was excreted within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was detected in the faeces.
After the intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml/ min and the systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml/ min.
Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95% within six hours after intravenous administration.
Taking into account the release of alendronate from the skeleton, the human terminal half-life is estimated at over ten years.
In rats, alendronate is not excreted via the acidic or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and is therefore not thought to affect excretion of other medicinal products by these transport systems in humans.
Absorption In healthy adult subjects (women and men) after nocturnal fasting and 2 hours before meal, the mean surface area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC0-120 h) for vitamin D3 was 296.4 ng h<unk> ml (excluding endogenous vitamin D3 levels).
The mean maximum concentration in the serum (Cmax) of vitamin D3 was 5.9 ng/ ml and the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (Tmax) was 12 hours.
The bioavailability of 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 in ADROVANCE is comparable to 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 alone.
Distribution After absorption, vitamin D3 is absorbed into the blood as a component of chylomicrons.
Vitamin D3 is rapidly dispersed, mainly into the liver, where it is metabolised into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the main storage form.
Smaller amounts are distributed in fat and muscle tissue and are stored there as vitamin D3 in order to be released into the circulation system.
Circulating vitamin D3 is bound to vitamin D binding protein.
Biotransformation Vitamin D3 is rapidly hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and then metabolised in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the biologically active form.
Further hydroxylation occurs before excretion.
A small amount of vitamin D3 is glucuronised before excretion.
<unk> When radioactively labelled vitamin D3 was administered to healthy subjects, the mean excretion of radioactivity in urine after 48 hours was 2.4%, in faeces 4.9 <unk>.
In both cases, radioactivity was excreted almost exclusively as metabolites of the starting substance.
The mean half-life of vitamin D3 in serum is approximately 24 hours after an oral dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU).
Characteristics in Patients Preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate not deposited in the bone is rapidly excreted via urine.
s absorption ability after long-term doses, from cumulative intravenous doses to
10 35 mg/ kg in animals. Although no clinical data are available, renal elimination of alendronate is expected to be reduced, as in animal studies, even in patients with impaired renal function.
Therefore, in patients with impaired renal function, a slightly increased accumulation of alendronate in the bone is to be expected (see section 4.2).
No non-clinical trials of the combination of alendronate and colecalciferol were conducted.
Alendronate Non-clinical data based on conventional studies in safety pharmacology, chronic toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential reveal no particular risks to humans.
Studies in rats showed that the administration of alendronate to pregnant rats was associated with the occurrence of dystocia in the dam due to hypocalcaemia.
In studies, high doses in rats increased the occurrence of incomplete ossification in the fetus.
The significance of this observation for humans is unknown.
Colecalciferol Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity at doses far greater than the therapeutic dose in humans.

Treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in patients at risk for vitamin D deficiency who are not receiving additional vitamin D supplementation.
ADROVANCE reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.
The recommended dosage is one ADROVANCE tablet weekly.
In view of the course of osteoporosis, ADROVANCE is intended for long-term therapy.
Notes to ensure adequate absorption of alendronate:
ADROVANCE should only be taken with water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before your first meal, drink or take medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.
Other beverages (including mineral water), food and some medicinal products may affect the absorption of alendronate (see section 4.5).
The following instructions should be followed closely in order to reduce the risk of oesophageal irritation and associated side effects (see section 4.4):
ADROVANCE should only be swallowed with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after waking up. Patients should not chew the tablet or allow the tablet to melt in their mouth as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcers. Patients should not lie down before the first food intake of the day, which should not occur before 30 minutes after taking the tablet.
13 Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking ADROVANCE. ADROVANCE should not be taken before bedtime or the first rise of the day.
Patients should be supplemented with calcium if food is not sufficient (see section 4.4).
The equivalent of taking 5.600 IU
Vitamin D3 once a week in ADROVANCE and 800 IU.
Vitamin D given once a day has not been studied.
In clinical trials, there was no age-related difference in the efficacy or safety profile of alendronate.
Dose adjustment is therefore not necessary in the elderly.
In patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 35 ml/ min, a dose adjustment is not necessary.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for patients with impaired renal function with GFR below 35 ml/ min due to lack of experience.
ADROVANCE has not been studied in children and adolescents and should therefore not be used in them.
Hypersensitivity to any active substance or ingredients. Oesophagus disorders and other factors that delay oesophageal emptying, such as stricture or achalasia. Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes. Hypocalcaemia.
Alendronate Alendronate can cause local irritation of the mucosae of the upper gastrointestinal tract.
Due to the possible worsening of the underlying disease, alendronate should only be given with special caution in patients with active gastrointestinal disorders such as dysphagia, oesophagus disorders, gastritis, duodenitis, ulcers, or with recent (within the last year), severe gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or upper gastrointestinal surgery except pyloroplasty (see section 4.3).
Oesophageal reactions such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosion, rarely followed by oesophageal stricture, were reported in patients taking alendronate (some of these were severe and required hospitalization).
The doctor should therefore pay close attention to all signs and symptoms indicating possible oesophageal reactions and patients should be advised to discontinue and seek medical advice if symptoms of oesophageal irritation such as dysphagia, swallowing pain or retrostar pain or new or worsening heartburn occur (see section 4.8).
<unk> The risk of severe oesophageal adverse reactions appears to be increased in patients who are not taking the medicinal product correctly, or who continue to take it after symptoms suggesting oesophageal irritation occur.
It is very important that all dosage instructions are communicated to the patient and understood by the patient
14 (see section 4.2). Patients should be advised that if they do not follow these instructions, the risk of oesophageal problems may be increased.
While large-scale clinical trials of alendronate have not shown an increased risk, gastric and duodenal ulcers, some severe and with complications, have rarely been reported (see section 4.8).
Osteonecrosis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose regimens primarily contain intravenous bisphosphonates.
Many of these patients also received chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has also been reported in osteoporosis patients receiving oral bisphosphonates.
A dental examination with appropriate preventive measures should be preceded by treatment with bisphosphonates if patients exhibit corresponding risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, periodontitis).
During treatment, these patients should avoid maxillofacial surgery as much as possible.
If patients develop osteonecrosis of the jaw during bisphosphonate therapy, maxillofacial surgery may result in aggravation.
There is no data to indicate whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy in patients requiring maxillofacial surgery reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
The clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning for each patient on the basis of an individual benefit-risk-assessment.
Bone, joint and muscle pain have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates.
These symptoms were seldom severe and/ or associated with impairment of mobility (see section 4.8).
The onset of these symptoms varied from one day to several months after initiation of therapy.
In most patients, discomfort decreased after discontinuation of therapy.
In some patients, symptoms recurred when therapy with the same product or another bisphosphonate was resumed.
Patients should be advised that if they fail to take a dose of ADROVANCE, they should take the tablet the next morning after noticing their failure.
You should not take two tablets on the same day, but should continue taking one tablet per week on the designated day of the week as originally planned.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for renal failure patients with GFR below 35 ml/ min (see section 4.2).
Other possible causes of osteoporosis besides oestrogen deficiency and age should be considered.
<unk> Existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected before starting therapy with ADROVANCE (see section 4.3).
Other disorders that impair mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with ADROVANCE.
The vitamin D content of ADROVANCE is not suitable for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency.
In patients with these disorders serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcaemia should be monitored under ADROVANCE therapy.
Due to the stimulation of bone mineralisation by alendronate, decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur.
However, rare cases of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, some severe, were reported, often in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (e. g. hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption) (see section 4.8).
Colecalciferol Vitamin D3 may increase the severity of hypercalcaemia and/ or hypercalciuria when administered to patients with disorders associated with uncontrolled overproduction of calcitriol (e. g. leukaemia, lymphoma, sarcoidosis).
In these patients urine and serum calcium should be monitored.
Patients with malabsorption may not take sufficient vitamin D3.
Other ingredients This medicinal product contains lactose and sucrose.
This medicinal product should not be used by patients with rare hereditary fructose intolerance, galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and forms of interaction
Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.
Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking other medicinal products (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
No other clinically relevant interactions with medicinal products are expected.
In clinical trials, several patients received oestrogen (intravaginal, transdermal or oral) together with alendronate.
No adverse reactions resulting from this combined use were observed.
Although no specific interaction studies have been conducted, alendronate has been used in clinical trials alongside a wide range of commonly prescribed medicinal products without clinically relevant interactions.
Cholestyramine, colestipol) may impair the absorption of vitamin D.
Anticonvulsants, cimetidine and thiazides can increase the metabolism of vitamin D.
Additional supplementation with vitamin D should be considered individually.
ADROVANCE is designed only for use in post-menopausal women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or by nursing women.
There are no adequate data on the use of ADROVANCE in pregnant women.
Animal studies of alendronate show no evidence of directly damaging effects on pregnancy, foetal or postnatal development.
Alendronate given to pregnant rats caused dystocia associated with hypocalcaemia (see section 5.3).
Animal studies have shown hypercalcaemia and reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3) at high doses.
It is not known whether alendronate is metabolised into breast milk.
Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites are absorbed into breast milk.

Rare: symptomatic hypocalcaemia, usually in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (see section 4.4).
Rare: transient symptoms of acute phase reaction (myalgia, discomfort and rare fever), usually at the start of therapy.
Following reactions have been reported (frequency unknown):
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates; most reports have been from cancer patients, but osteoporosis patients have also been reported.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw is usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis).
Cancer diagnosis, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also considered risk factors (see section 4.4).
Laboratory values In clinical trials, asymptomatic, mild and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18% and 10% respectively of those taking alendronate 10 mg/ day, compared with approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo.
However, decreases in serum calcium to <unk> 8.0 mg/ dl (2.0 mmol/ l) and in serum phosphate to 2.0 mg/ dl (0.65 mmol/ l) occurred with a similar frequency in both treatment groups.
Alendronate Oral overdose may result in hypocalcaemia, hypophosphatemia and upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as upset stomach, heartburn, oesophagitis, gastritis or ulcers.
There is no specific experience in treating an overdose with alendronate.
In case of an overdose with ADROVANCE, milk or antacids should be given to bind alendronate.

Colecalciferol In long-term therapy of generally healthy adults, no vitamin D toxicity was documented for doses of less than 10,000 IU/ day. In a clinical trial in healthy adults, a daily dose of 4,000 IU
Vitamin D3 for up to 5 months is not associated with hypercalciuria or hypercalcaemia.
ADROVANCE is a combination tablet with the active ingredients sodium alendronate 3 H2O and colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Alendronate Sodium alendronate 3 H2O is a bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts without exerting a direct effect on bone formation.
Preclinical studies have shown that alendronate primarily concentrates at sites of active absorption.
The activity of the osteoclasts is inhibited, but recruitment and binding of the osteoclasts are not affected.
The bone formed under alendronate therapy is of normal quality.
18 Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol into vitamin D3.
In cases of insufficient exposure to the sun, it is essential that vitamin D3 is a component of food.
Vitamin D3 is converted into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the liver and stored until it is needed.
The conversion to the active calcium mobilising hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) in the kidney is strictly regulated.
The main effect of 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and to regulate serum calcium, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.
Vitamin D3 is necessary for normal bone formation.
A vitamin D deficiency occurs when exposure to the sun and food intake are insufficient.
Deficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, bone loss and an increased risk of skeletal fractures.
In severe cases, deficiency may lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphataemia, weakness of proximal muscles and osteomalacia and thus a further increased risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic subjects.
Supplementation with vitamin D lowers these risks and their consequences.
Bone mineral density) in the spine or hip, which is 2.5 standard deviations below the mean for a normal, young population, or regardless of bone density as a pathological fracture.
<unk> Studies with ADROVANCE The effect of the lower dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronate/ 2,800 IU of vitamin D3) on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15 week, multinational trial in 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis (mean baseline of 25-hydroxyvitamin D: 56 nmol/ l <unk> 22.3 ng/ ml; range: 22.5 -225 nmol/ l <unk> 9-90 ng/ ml <unk>).
Patients received ADROVANCE in the lower dose (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n<unk> 350) or FOSAMAX (alendronate) 70 mg once weekly (n<unk> 332) and no other vitamin D supplements.
After 15 weeks of treatment, mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher (26%) in the ADROVANCE group (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (56 nmol/ l <unk> 23 ng/ ml <unk>) than in the alendronate group alone (46 nmol/ l <unk> 18.2 ng/ ml <unk>).
ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) significantly decreased the proportion of patients with vitamin D insufficiency (serum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <unk> 37.5 nmol/ l <unk> <unk> 15 ng/ ml <unk>) by 62.5% compared to alendronate alone (12% vs.
32%).
ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <unk> 22.5 nmol/ l <unk> <unk> 9 ng/ ml <unk>) by 92% compared to alendronate alone (1% vs. 13%).
In this study, after 15 weeks, mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in vitamin D deficient patients at baseline (25-hydroxyvitamin D 22.5 to 37.5 nmol/ l <unk> 9 - <unk> 15 ng/ ml <unk>) increased from 30 nmol/ l (12.1 ng/ ml) to 40 nmol/ l (15.9 ng/ ml) in the ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n<unk> 75) group and decreased from 30 nmol/ l (12.0 ng/ ml) at baseline to 26 nmol/ l (10.4 ng/ ml) in the alendronate alone group (n<unk> 70).
There were no differences between the treatment groups with regard to the mean values of serum calcium, phosphate or calcium in 24-hour urine.
The effect of the lower dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronate/ 2,800 IU of vitamin D3) with an additional dose of 2,800 IU of vitamin D3, totaling 5,600 IU
vitamin D3 (equivalent to the amount of vitamin D3 in the higher dose of ADROVANCE) given weekly was shown in a 24 week extension study in 619 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.
<unk> 299 ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n<unk> 299) and 5,600 IU D3 received ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) and an additional 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 (n<unk> 309) once a week; additional vitamin D supplements were permitted; after 24 weeks of treatment, mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher in the 5,600 IU D3 (69 nmol/ l <unk> 27.6 ng/ ml <unk>) than in the 2,800 IU D3 (64 nmol/ l <unk> 25.5 ng/ ml <unk>).
The proportion of patients with vitamin D insufficiency during the 24-week extension study was 5.4% in the 2.800 IU/ D3 group vs.
3.2% in the 5.600 IU vitamin D3 group. The proportion of patients with
19 vitamin D deficiency was 0.3% in the 2.800 IU/ D3 group vs. 0% in the 5.600 IU/ D3 group.
There were no differences between the treatment groups with regard to the mean values of serum calcium, phosphate or calcium in 24-hour urine.
There was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups in the proportion of patients with hypercalciuria at the end of 24 weeks.
Studies of alendronate The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate given weekly 70 mg (n<unk> 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n<unk> 370) was established in a one-year multicenter trial in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.
After one year, increases over baseline lumbar BMD were 5.1% (95% CI:
4.8, 5.4%) in the 70 mg weekly and 5.4% (95% CI:
5.0, 5.8%) in the 10 mg daily group.
The mean BMD increases were 2.3% and 2.9% respectively at the femoral neck and 2.9% and 3.1% at the total hip in the 70 mg weekly and 10 mg daily respectively.
The two treatment groups were also comparable in BMD increases at other skeletal sites.
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were investigated in two Phase II studies of identical design (n<unk> 944) and in the Fracture Intervention (FIT: n<unk> 6,459).
In the Phase IIII trials, mean increases in BMD with alendronate were 10 mg/ day versus placebo at 3 years 8.8% in the spine, 5.9% in the femoral neck and 7.8% in the trochanter.
The BMD of the total skeleton also increased significantly.
In the alendronate treated group, a 48% reduction (alendronate 3.2% vs. placebo 6.2%) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more vertebral fractures.
In the 2 -year extension of these studies, increases in BMD of the spine and trochanter were sustained, and BMD of the femoral neck and entire body was maintained.
FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled trials in which alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and subsequently 10 mg daily for either 1 or 2 years):
FIT 1: a three year trial involving 2,027 patients with at least one pre-existing vertebral <unk> <unk> compression <unk> fracture.
In this study, daily administration of alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% vs. placebo 15.0%).
In addition, a significant reduction in the incidence of hip fractures (1.1% vs. 2.2%; reduction of 51%) was observed.
FIT 2: a four year trial involving 4,432 patients with low bone mass but without pre-existing vertebral fracture.
In this study, a significant difference in the incidence of hip fractures (alendronate 1.0% vs. placebo 2.2%; reduction of 56%) and in the incidence of at least one vertebral fracture (2.9% vs. 5.8%; reduction of 50%) was observed in the analysis of the subgroup of osteoporotic women (37% of the total number who suffered from osteoporosis as defined above).
<unk> Absorption Mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nocturnal fasting and 2 hours prior to eating a standardized breakfast.
Bioavailability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% when alendronate was administered one or half an hour prior to a standardized breakfast.
20. In osteoporosis studies, alendronate was effective if taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.
The alendronate component of the ADROVANCE combination tablet (70 mg/ 5,600 IU) and a tablet of 70 mg alendronate are bioequivalent.
Bioavailability was minimal when alendronate was used with or up to two hours after a standardized breakfast.
Taking alendronate together with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by about 60%.
In healthy subjects the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg 3 times daily for five days) did not result in a clinically important change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the mean range of 20% to 44%).
Distribution studies in rats have shown that after intravenous administration of 1 mg/ kg alendronate transiently dissipates into soft tissue, but is then rapidly redistributed into bone or excreted with urine.
The mean steady-state volume of the distribution is at least 28 litres in humans, excluding bone.
Plasma concentrations after oral therapeutic doses of alendronate are too low for analytical detection (<unk> 5 ng/ ml).
<unk> protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78 <unk>.
Biotransformation There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolised in animals or humans.
Excretion Following the intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactively labelled substance was excreted within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was detected in the faeces.
After the intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml/ min and the systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml/ min.
Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95% within six hours after intravenous administration.
Taking into account the release of alendronate from the skeleton, the human terminal half-life is estimated at over ten years.
In rats, alendronate is not excreted via the acidic or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and is therefore not thought to affect excretion of other medicinal products by these transport systems in humans.
<unk> Absorption In healthy adult subjects (women and men) after the administration of ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 5,600 IU) after nocturnal fasting and two hours before meal, the mean surface area below the serum concentration time curve (AUC0-80 h) for vitamin D3 was 490.2 ng h<unk> ml (excluding endogenous vitamin D3 levels).
The mean maximum concentration in the serum (Cmax) of vitamin D3 was 12.2 ng/ ml and the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (Tmax) was 10.6 hours.
The bioavailability of 5.600 IU of vitamin D3 in ADROVANCE is comparable to 5.600 IU of vitamin D3 taken alone.
Distribution After absorption, vitamin D3 is absorbed into the blood as a component of chylomicrons.
Vitamin D3 is rapidly dispersed, mainly into the liver, where it is metabolised into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the main storage form.
Smaller amounts are distributed in fat and muscle tissue and are stored there as vitamin D3 in order to be released into the circulation system.
Circulating vitamin D3 is bound to vitamin D binding protein.
21 Vitamin D3 is rapidly hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and then metabolised in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the biologically active form.
Further hydroxylation occurs before excretion.
A small amount of vitamin D3 is glucuronised before excretion.
<unk> When radioactively labelled vitamin D3 was administered to healthy subjects, the mean excretion of radioactivity in urine after 48 hours was 2.4%, in faeces 4.9 <unk>.
In both cases, radioactivity was excreted almost exclusively as metabolites of the starting substance.
The mean half-life of vitamin D3 in serum is approximately 24 hours after an oral dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU).
Characteristics in Patients Preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate not deposited in the bone is rapidly excreted via urine.
No evidence was found of bone absorption saturation after long-term doses of cumulative intravenous doses of up to 35 mg/ kg in animals.
Although no clinical data are available, renal elimination of alendronate is expected to be reduced in patients with impaired renal function, as in animal studies.
Therefore, in patients with impaired renal function, a slightly increased accumulation of alendronate in the bone is to be expected (see section 4.2).
No non-clinical trials of the combination of alendronate and colecalciferol were conducted.
Alendronate Non-clinical data based on conventional studies in safety pharmacology, chronic toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential reveal no particular risks to humans.
Studies in rats showed that the administration of alendronate to pregnant rats was associated with the occurrence of dystocia in the dam due to hypocalcaemia.
In studies, high doses in rats increased the occurrence of incomplete ossification in the fetus.
The significance of this observation for humans is unknown.
Colecalciferol Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity at doses far greater than the therapeutic dose in humans.

This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) explaining how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations on the use of the product.
If you need more information about your disease or treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also included in EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
Advate consists of a powder and a solvent, which are mixed to produce a solution for injection.
Advate contains the active substance Octocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII).
Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by deficiency of factor VIII).
Advate is indicated for both short- and long-term use.
This medicinal product is only available on a doctor's prescription.
Treatment with Advate should be initiated by a doctor with experience in the treatment of haemophilia.
Advate is administered by injection into a vein at a rate of up to 10 ml per minute.
The dosage and frequency of use depend on whether Advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgery.
The dosage is also adjusted to the severity of bleeding and type of surgery.
Detailed explanations for the calculation of doses are given in the package leaflet.
The active substance in Advate, Octocog alfa, is a clotting factor protein.
Factor VIII is one of the substances (factors) in the body involved in blood clotting.
Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a Factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.
Advate is used to replace the missing factor VIII.
It corrects factor VIII-deficiency and enables a transient control of the bleeding disorder.
Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced using a method known as recombinant DNA technology:
It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) has been introduced that enables it to form the human clotting factor VIII.

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. How has Advate been investigated? Advate is similar to another medicinal product authorised in the European Union called Recombinate, but manufactured in a different way so that the medicinal product contains no proteins of human or animal origin.
Therefore, in a main study involving 111 patients with haemophilia A, Advate was compared with Recombinate to show that both medicinal products are equivalent. In addition, the number of bleeding episodes in 107 patients receiving all Advate was evaluated and the efficacy of Advate in haemostasis was evaluated on a scale from ineffective to excellent. Three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a trial involving 53 children under six years of age, investigated the use of the product for haematological prevention and surgery.
What benefit has Advate shown in these trials?
In the main study, the efficacy of Advate in preventing bleeding in 86% of 510 new bleeding episodes was excellent or well evaluated.
In addition, in 81% of these bleeding episodes, only one treatment with Advate was necessary.
The additional studies, including the study in children under six years of age, confirmed the efficacy of Advate.
Patients with haemophilia A may form antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII.
An antibody is a protein produced by the body by its natural protective mechanism in response to unknown substances.
If antibodies develop, the efficacy of Advate is not assured.
The most common adverse reactions of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII.
In some patients treated with products containing factor VIII, hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) was observed.
See the Package Leaflet for a full list of reported adverse reactions associated with Advate.
<unk> Advate should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the ingredients.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Advate in the treatment and propyhlaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital deficiency of factor VIII) outweigh the risks and recommended authorisation for the marketing of Advate.
On 2 March 2004, the European Commission authorised Baxter AG to market Advate throughout the European Union.
The authorisation was renewed on 2 March 2009.
The full text of the EPAR for Advate is available here.
Powder: Vial (glass) Solvent: vial (glass)
1 vial + 1 vial + reconstitution device
ADVATE 250 IU powder and solvent to produce a solution for injection
Each bottle contains a nominal 250 IU/ recombinant coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) Octocog alfa<unk> *.
After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains approximately 50 IU/ ml of Octocog alfa.
<unk> The activity (international units) is determined by the chromogenic assay against an in-house standard related to the WHO standard. Specific activity is approximately 4,000-10,000 IU/ mg protein. <unk> <unk> human clotting factor VIII is produced by recombinant DNA technology in ovarian cells of the Chinese hamster (CHO).
<unk> <unk> Prepared without the addition of an (exogenous) human or animal protein during cell culture, purification and final formulation.
0.45 mmol sodium chloride (10 mg) per vial.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free of foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3.
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be carried out under the supervision of a doctor familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of Factor VIII deficiency, the site and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.
<unk> The Factor VIII dose is given in International Units (IU) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII-products.
The factor VIII-activity in plasma is given either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
2 One IU of factor VIII-activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the necessary Factor VIII dose is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU
Factor VIII per kg body weight increases factor VIIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII-increase (%) x 0.5
In the case of subsequent haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII-activity should not decrease below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in IU/ dl).
The following Table 1 indicates dosage in haemorrhage and surgery:
Table 1: Dosage in haemorrhage events and operations Grade of haemorrhage / type of surgery Haemorrhage
Necessary factor VIII plasma level (% or IU/ dl)
Frequency of dosage (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
Early joint bleeding, muscle bleeding or bleeding in the mouth.
Repeat the injection every 12 to 24 hours (8 to 24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until the bleeding is indicated by pain or healing.
More pronounced joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or haematoma.
Repeat the injection every 12 -24 hours (8 -24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for 3 -4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.
Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until the risk to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
Injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years) until adequate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity of 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of Factor VIII-plasma levels is recommended in order to control the dose and frequency of injections.
Especially in major surgery, close monitoring of substitution therapy by determining factor VIII-activity in the plasma is essential.
Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-lives.
3 Prophylaxis Long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A doses between 20 and 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight should be administered 2-3 days apart.
In patients under 6 years of age, doses between 20 and 50 IU Factor VIII per kg body weight 3 4 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored regularly for formation of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitors, Factor VIII-therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures should be considered.
These therapies should only be carried out by physicians with experience in treating patients with haemophilia. See section 4.4.
method of use ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is necessary.
The rate of administration should vary with the condition of the patient and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml/ min should not be exceeded.
In the interests of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, note down the name and batch number of the product.
For information on reconstitution prior to administration see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the other ingredients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, allergic hypersensitivity reactions can occur.
This product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be aware of immediate signs of hypersensitivity reaction such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory discomfort (e. g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should immediately discontinue treatment and contact their doctor.
In the event of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be carried out in accordance with current medical standards (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are inhibitors directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by a modified Bethesda assay.
In patients who develop factor VIII inhibitors, this may result in an inadequate clinical response.
In such cases it is recommended to contact a haemophilia centre.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the greatest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and depending on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 days of exposure and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (lowtitrate) inhibitors was observed after conversion from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
4 This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial after reconstitution.
This should be considered in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5. Interaction with other medicinal products and forms of interaction
No studies on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been carried out.
Animal reproduction studies were not carried out with factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, no experience exists of the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
Therefore, Factor VIII should only be used during pregnancy and lactation if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machinery
ADVATE has no impact on ability to drive and use machinery.
As with any intravenous protein, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type are possible (see section 4.4).
During clinical trials of ADVATE, a total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 out of 234 once treated patients.
The most common ADRs were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients at higher risk for inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Of the total of 56 adverse reactions, no were observed in newborns, 16 were reported in 13<unk> 32 infants, 7 in 4<unk> 56 children, 8 in 4<unk> 31 adolescents and 25 in 14<unk> 94 adults.
The frequency categories are defined by the following criteria: Very common (1<unk> 10), common (1<unk> 100 to <unk> 1<unk> 10), uncommon (1<unk> 1,000 to <unk> 1<unk> 100), rare (1<unk> 10,000 to <unk> 1<unk> 1,000), very rare <unk> <unk> 10,000), unknown (frequency cannot be estimated based on available data).
Within the frequencies, adverse reactions are listed in descending severity.
The following Table 2 shows the frequency of adverse events in clinical trials:

a) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in blood coagulation factor VIIII occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperatively) in a continuous ADVATE infusion patient.
Clotting was maintained throughout and both the factor VIII levels in the plasma and the clearance rate returned to adequate levels on the 15th post-operative day.
After the continuous infusion, tests for factor VIII-inhibitors were carried out and were negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient exhibited a low inhibitortiter (2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
Furthermore, in none of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days), an FVIII inhibitor was detected.
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) ADVATE treated patients were inhibitors against factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titer (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The frequency of detection of FVIII inhibitors thus far is in line with expectations and in the range already observed.
s immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by antibody titers to these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 exhibited a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients exhibited sustained peaks or transient peaks.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity occurred.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 exhibited a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients exhibited a sustained peak or transient peak.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to murine IgG.
In four patients, isolated occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes were reported during multiple repeated product exposures.
7 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE has been reported to exhibit allergic type hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency unknown).
Human overdose symptoms with recombinant coagulation factor VIII are not known.

Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 280 kD.
When Octocog alfa is injected into a haemophilia A patient, it binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor in the bloodstream.
The activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
The activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clotting can occur.
Haemophilia A is a genital, hereditary blood clotting disorder due to decreased Factor VIII-levels.
This results in severe bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
The factors VIII-plasma levels are increased by substitution therapy, whereby a transient correction of the factor VIII-deficiency and the tendency to bleed occurs.
All pharmacokinetics studies of ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
The evaluation of the plasma samples was carried out in a central laboratory using a single-stage clotting test.
The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or <unk> 10 years, are listed in Table 3 below.

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be carried out under the supervision of a doctor familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of Factor VIII deficiency, the site and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.
<unk> The Factor VIII dose is given in International Units (IU) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII-products.
The factor VIII-activity in plasma is given either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
13 One IU of factor VIII-activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the necessary Factor VIII dose is based on empirical evidence that 1 IU of Factor VIII per kg body weight increases Factor VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII-increase (%) x 0.5
In the case of subsequent haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII-activity should not decrease below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in IU/ dl).

Injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years) until adequate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity of 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of Factor VIII-plasma levels is recommended in order to control the dose and frequency of injections.
Especially in major surgery, close monitoring of substitution therapy by determining factor VIII-activity in the plasma is essential.
Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-lives.
14 Prophylaxis Long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A doses between 20 and 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight should be administered 2-3 days apart.
In patients under 6 years of age, doses between 20 and 50 IU Factor VIII per kg body weight 3 4 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored regularly for formation of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitors, Factor VIII-therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures should be considered.

If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is necessary.
The rate of administration should vary with the condition of the patient and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml/ min should not be exceeded.
In the interests of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, note down the name and batch number of the product.
For information on reconstitution prior to administration see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the other ingredients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, allergic hypersensitivity reactions can occur.
This product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be aware of immediate signs of hypersensitivity reaction such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory discomfort (e. g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should immediately discontinue treatment and contact their doctor.
In the event of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be carried out in accordance with current medical standards (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.

All patients treated with clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
15 This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial after reconstitution.
This should be considered in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5. Interaction with other medicinal products and forms of interaction
No studies on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been carried out.
Animal reproduction studies were not carried out with factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, no experience exists of the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
Therefore, Factor VIII should only be used during pregnancy and lactation if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machinery
ADVATE has no impact on ability to drive and use machinery.
As with any intravenous protein, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type are possible (see section 4.4).
During clinical trials of ADVATE, a total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 out of 234 once treated patients.
The most common ADRs were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients at higher risk for inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Of the total of 56 adverse reactions, no were observed in newborns, 16 were reported in 13<unk> 32 infants, 7 in 4<unk> 56 children, 8 in 4<unk> 31 adolescents and 25 in 14<unk> 94 adults.
The frequency categories are defined by the following criteria: Very common (1<unk> 10), common (1<unk> 100 to <unk> 1<unk> 10), uncommon (1<unk> 1,000 to <unk> 1<unk> 100), rare (1<unk> 10,000 to <unk> 1<unk> 1,000), very rare <unk> <unk> 10,000), unknown (frequency cannot be estimated based on available data).

a) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in blood coagulation factor VIIII occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperatively) in a continuous ADVATE infusion patient.
Clotting was maintained throughout and both the factor VIII levels in the plasma and the clearance rate returned to adequate levels on the 15th post-operative day.
After the continuous infusion, tests for factor VIII-inhibitors were carried out and were negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient exhibited a low inhibitortiter (2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
Furthermore, in none of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days), an FVIII inhibitor was detected.
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) ADVATE treated patients were inhibitors against factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titer (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The frequency of detection of FVIII inhibitors thus far is in line with expectations and in the range already observed.
s immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by antibody titers to these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 exhibited a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients exhibited sustained peaks or transient peaks.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity occurred.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 exhibited a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients exhibited a sustained peak or transient peak.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to murine IgG.
In four patients, isolated occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes were reported during multiple repeated product exposures.
18 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE has been reported to exhibit allergic type hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency unknown).
Human overdose symptoms with recombinant coagulation factor VIII are not known.
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
The factor VIII/ of Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and of Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions.
ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII (Octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 280 kD.
When Octocog alfa is injected into a haemophilia A patient, it binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor in the bloodstream.
The activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
The activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clotting can occur.
Haemophilia A is a genital, hereditary blood clotting disorder due to decreased Factor VIII-levels.
This results in severe bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
The factors VIII-plasma levels are increased by substitution therapy, whereby a transient correction of the factor VIII-deficiency and the tendency to bleed occurs.
All pharmacokinetics studies of ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
The evaluation of the plasma samples was carried out in a central laboratory using a single-stage clotting test.
The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or <unk> 10 years, are listed in Table 3 below.

After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free of foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3.
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be carried out under the supervision of a doctor familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of Factor VIII deficiency, the site and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.
<unk> The Factor VIII dose is given in International Units (IU) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII-products.
The factor VIII-activity in plasma is given either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
24 IU of factor VIII-activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in a ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the necessary Factor VIII dose is based on empirical evidence that 1 IU of Factor VIII per kg body weight increases Factor VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII-increase (%) x 0.5
In the case of subsequent haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII-activity should not decrease below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in IU/ dl).
The following Table 1 indicates dosage in haemorrhage and surgery:
Table 1: Dosage in haemorrhage events and operations Grade of haemorrhage / type of surgery Haemorrhage
Necessary factor VIII plasma level (% or IU/ dl)
Frequency of dosage (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
Early joint bleeding, muscle bleeding or bleeding in the mouth.
Repeat the injection every 12 to 24 hours (8 to 24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until the bleeding is indicated by pain or healing.
More pronounced joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or haematoma.
Repeat the injection every 12 -24 hours (8 -24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for 3 -4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.
Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until the risk to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
Injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years) until adequate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity of 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of Factor VIII-plasma levels is recommended in order to control the dose and frequency of injections.
Especially in major surgery, close monitoring of substitution therapy by determining factor VIII-activity in the plasma is essential.
Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-lives.
25 Prophylaxis Long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A doses between 20 and 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight should be administered 2-3 days apart.
In patients under 6 years of age, doses between 20 and 50 IU Factor VIII per kg body weight 3 4 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored regularly for formation of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitors, Factor VIII-therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures should be considered.
These therapies should only be carried out by physicians with experience in treating patients with haemophilia. See section 4.4.
method of use ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is necessary.
The rate of administration should vary with the condition of the patient and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml/ min should not be exceeded.
In the interests of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, note down the name and batch number of the product.
For information on reconstitution prior to administration see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the other ingredients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, allergic hypersensitivity reactions can occur.
This product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be aware of immediate signs of hypersensitivity reaction such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory discomfort (e. g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should immediately discontinue treatment and contact their doctor.
In the event of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be carried out in accordance with current medical standards (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are inhibitors directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by a modified Bethesda assay.
In patients who develop factor VIII inhibitors, this may result in an inadequate clinical response.
In such cases it is recommended to contact a haemophilia centre.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the greatest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and depending on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 days of exposure and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (lowtitrate) inhibitors was observed after conversion from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
26 This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial after reconstitution.
This should be considered in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5. Interaction with other medicinal products and forms of interaction
No studies on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been carried out.
Animal reproduction studies were not carried out with factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, no experience exists of the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
Therefore, Factor VIII should only be used during pregnancy and lactation if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machinery
ADVATE has no impact on ability to drive and use machinery.
As with any intravenous protein, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type are possible (see section 4.4).
During clinical trials of ADVATE, a total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 out of 234 once treated patients.
The most common ADRs were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients at higher risk for inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Of the total of 56 adverse reactions, no were reported in newborns, 16 in 13<unk> 32 infants, 7 in 4<unk> 56 children, 8 in 4<unk> 31 adolescents and 25 in 14<unk> 94 adults.

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be carried out under the supervision of a doctor familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of Factor VIII deficiency, the site and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.
<unk> The Factor VIII dose is given in International Units (IU) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII-products.
The factor VIII-activity in plasma is given either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
35 One IU of factor VIII-activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the necessary Factor VIII dose is based on empirical evidence that 1 IU of Factor VIII per kg body weight increases Factor VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII-increase (%) x 0.5
In the case of subsequent haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII-activity should not decrease below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in IU/ dl).

Injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years) until adequate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity of 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of Factor VIII-plasma levels is recommended in order to control the dose and frequency of injections.
Especially in major surgery, close monitoring of substitution therapy by determining factor VIII-activity in the plasma is essential.
Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-lives.
36 Prophylaxis Long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A doses between 20 and 40 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight should be administered 2-3 days apart.
In patients under 6 years of age, doses between 20 and 50 IU Factor VIII per kg body weight 3 4 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored regularly for formation of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitors, Factor VIII-therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures should be considered.
These therapies should only be carried out by physicians with experience in treating patients with haemophilia. See section 4.4.
method of use ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is necessary.
The rate of administration should vary with the condition of the patient and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml/ min should not be exceeded.
In the interests of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, note down the name and batch number of the product.
For information on reconstitution prior to administration see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the other ingredients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, allergic hypersensitivity reactions can occur.
This product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be aware of immediate signs of hypersensitivity reaction such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory discomfort (e. g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should immediately discontinue treatment and contact their doctor.
In the event of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be carried out in accordance with current medical standards (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are inhibitors directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by a modified Bethesda assay.
In patients who develop factor VIII inhibitors, this may result in an inadequate clinical response.
In such cases it is recommended to contact a haemophilia centre.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the greatest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and depending on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 days of exposure and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (lowtitrate) inhibitors was observed after conversion from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
37 This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial after reconstitution.
This should be considered in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5. Interaction with other medicinal products and forms of interaction
No studies on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been carried out.
Animal reproduction studies were not carried out with factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, no experience exists of the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
Therefore, Factor VIII should only be used during pregnancy and lactation if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machinery
ADVATE has no impact on ability to drive and use machinery.
As with any intravenous protein, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type are possible (see section 4.4).
During clinical trials of ADVATE, a total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 out of 234 once treated patients.
The most common ADRs were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients at higher risk for inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Of the total of 56 adverse reactions, no were observed in newborns, 16 in 13<unk> 32 infants, 7 in 4<unk> 56 children, 8 in 4<unk> 31 adolescents and 25 in 14<unk> 94 adults.
The frequency categories are defined by the following criteria: Very common (1<unk> 10), common (1<unk> 100 to <unk> 1<unk> 10), uncommon (1<unk> 1,000 to <unk> 1<unk> 100), rare (1<unk> 10,000 to <unk> 1<unk> 1,000), very rare <unk> <unk> 10,000), unknown (frequency cannot be estimated based on available data).
Within the frequencies, adverse reactions are listed in descending severity.
The following Table 2 shows the frequency of adverse events in clinical trials:

a) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in blood coagulation factor VIIII occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperatively) in a continuous ADVATE infusion patient.
Clotting was maintained throughout and both the factor VIII levels in the plasma and the clearance rate returned to adequate levels on the 15th post-operative day.
After the continuous infusion, tests for factor VIII-inhibitors were carried out and were negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients 8 with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient exhibited a low inhibitortiter (2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
Furthermore, in none of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days), an FVIII inhibitor was detected.
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) ADVATE treated patients were inhibitors against factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titer (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The frequency of detection of FVIII inhibitors thus far is in line with expectations and in the range already observed.
s immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by antibody titers to these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 exhibited a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients exhibited sustained peaks or transient peaks.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity occurred.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 exhibited a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients exhibited a sustained peak or transient peak.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to murine IgG.
In four patients, isolated occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes were reported during multiple repeated product exposures.
40 As with other intravenous products, hypersensitivity reactions of allergic type including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency unknown) have been reported in ADVATE.
Human overdose symptoms with recombinant coagulation factor VIII are not known.
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
The factor VIII/ of Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and of Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions.
ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII (Octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 280 kD.
When Octocog alfa is injected into a haemophilia A patient, it binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor in the bloodstream.
The activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
The activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clotting can occur.
Haemophilia A is a genital, hereditary blood clotting disorder due to decreased Factor VIII-levels.
This results in severe bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
The factors VIII-plasma levels are increased by substitution therapy, whereby a transient correction of the factor VIII-deficiency and the tendency to bleed occurs.
All pharmacokinetics studies of ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
The evaluation of the plasma samples was carried out in a central laboratory using a single-stage clotting test.
The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or <unk> 10 years, are listed in Table 3 below.

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be carried out under the supervision of a doctor familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of Factor VIII deficiency, the site and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.
<unk> The Factor VIII dose is given in International Units (IU) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII-products.
The factor VIII-activity in plasma is given either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
46 One IU of factor VIII-activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the necessary Factor VIII dose is based on empirical evidence that 1 IU of Factor VIII per kg body weight increases Factor VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII-increase (%) x 0.5
In the case of subsequent haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII-activity should not decrease below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in IU/ dl).
The following Table 1 indicates dosage in haemorrhage and surgery:
Table 1: Dosage in haemorrhage events and operations Grade of haemorrhage / type of surgery Haemorrhage
Necessary factor VIII plasma level (% or IU/ dl)
Frequency of dosage (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
Early joint bleeding, muscle bleeding or bleeding in the mouth.
Repeat the injection every 12 to 24 hours (8 to 24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until the bleeding is indicated by pain or healing.
More pronounced joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or haematoma.
Repeat the injection every 12 -24 hours (8 -24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for 3 -4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.
Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until the risk to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
Injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years) until adequate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity of 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of Factor VIII-plasma levels is recommended in order to control the dose and frequency of injections.
Especially in major surgery, close monitoring of substitution therapy by determining factor VIII-activity in the plasma is essential.
Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-lives.
47 Prophylaxis Long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A doses between 20 and 40 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight should be administered 2-3 days apart.
In patients under 6 years of age, doses between 20 and 50 IU Factor VIII per kg body weight 3 4 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored regularly for formation of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitors, Factor VIII-therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures should be considered.
These therapies should only be carried out by physicians with experience in treating patients with haemophilia. See section 4.4.
method of use ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is necessary.
The rate of administration should vary with the condition of the patient and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml/ min should not be exceeded.
In the interests of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, note down the name and batch number of the product.
For information on reconstitution prior to administration see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the other ingredients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, allergic hypersensitivity reactions can occur.
This product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be aware of immediate signs of hypersensitivity reaction such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory discomfort (e. g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should immediately discontinue treatment and contact their doctor.
In the event of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be carried out in accordance with current medical standards (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are inhibitors directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by a modified Bethesda assay.
In patients who develop factor VIII inhibitors, this may result in an inadequate clinical response.
In such cases it is recommended to contact a haemophilia centre.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the greatest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and depending on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 days of exposure and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (lowtitrate) inhibitors was observed after conversion from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
48 This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial after reconstitution.
This should be considered in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5. Interaction with other medicinal products and forms of interaction
No studies on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been carried out.
Animal reproduction studies were not carried out with factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, no experience exists of the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
Therefore, Factor VIII should only be used during pregnancy and lactation if there is a clear indication.

ADVATE 3000 IU powder and solvent to produce a solution for injection
Each bottle contains 3000 IU/ recombinant coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) Octocog alfa<unk> *.
After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains approximately 600 IU/ ml of Octocog alfa.
<unk> The activity (international units) is determined by the chromogenic assay against an in-house standard related to the WHO standard. Specific activity is approximately 4,000-10,000 IU/ mg protein. <unk> <unk> human clotting factor VIII is produced by recombinant DNA technology in ovarian cells of the Chinese hamster (CHO).
<unk> <unk> Prepared without the addition of an (exogenous) human or animal protein during cell culture, purification and final formulation.
0.45 mmol sodium chloride (10 mg) per vial.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free of foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3.
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be carried out under the supervision of a doctor familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of Factor VIII deficiency, the site and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.
<unk> The Factor VIII dose is given in International Units (IU) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII-products.
The factor VIII-activity in plasma is given either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
57 One IU of factor VIII-activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the necessary Factor VIII dose is based on empirical evidence that 1 IU of Factor VIII per kg body weight increases Factor VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII-increase (%) x 0.5
In the case of subsequent haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII-activity should not decrease below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in IU/ dl).
The following Table 1 indicates dosage in haemorrhage and surgery:
Table 1: Dosage in haemorrhage events and operations Grade of haemorrhage / type of surgery Haemorrhage
Necessary factor VIII plasma level (% or IU/ dl)
Frequency of dosage (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
Early joint bleeding, muscle bleeding or bleeding in the mouth.
Repeat the injection every 12 to 24 hours (8 to 24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until the bleeding is indicated by pain or healing.
More pronounced joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or haematoma.
Repeat the injection every 12 -24 hours (8 -24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for 3 -4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.
Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until the risk to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
Injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years) until adequate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity of 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of Factor VIII-plasma levels is recommended in order to control the dose and frequency of injections.
Especially in major surgery, close monitoring of substitution therapy by determining factor VIII-activity in the plasma is essential.
Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-lives.
58 Prophylaxis Long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A doses between 20 and 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight should be administered 2-3 days apart.
In patients under 6 years of age, doses between 20 and 50 IU Factor VIII per kg body weight 3 4 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored regularly for formation of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitors, Factor VIII-therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures should be considered.
These therapies should only be carried out by physicians with experience in treating patients with haemophilia. See section 4.4.
method of use ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is necessary.
The rate of administration should vary with the condition of the patient and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml/ min should not be exceeded.
In the interests of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, note down the name and batch number of the product.
For information on reconstitution prior to administration see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the other ingredients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, allergic hypersensitivity reactions can occur.
This product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be aware of immediate signs of hypersensitivity reaction such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory discomfort (e. g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should immediately discontinue treatment and contact their doctor.
In the event of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be carried out in accordance with current medical standards (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are inhibitors directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by a modified Bethesda assay.
In patients who develop factor VIII inhibitors, this may result in an inadequate clinical response.
In such cases it is recommended to contact a haemophilia centre.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the greatest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and depending on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 days of exposure and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (lowtitrate) inhibitors was observed after conversion from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
59 This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial after reconstitution.
This should be considered in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5. Interaction with other medicinal products and forms of interaction
No studies on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been carried out.
Animal reproduction studies were not carried out with factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, no experience exists of the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
Therefore, Factor VIII should only be used during pregnancy and lactation if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machinery
ADVATE has no impact on ability to drive and use machinery.
As with any intravenous protein, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type are possible (see section 4.4).
During clinical trials of ADVATE, a total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 out of 234 once treated patients.
The most common ADRs were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients at higher risk for inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Of the total of 56 adverse reactions, no were observed in newborns, 16 in 13<unk> 32 infants, 7 in 4<unk> 56 children, 8 in 4<unk> 31 adolescents and 25 in 14<unk> 94 adults.
The frequency categories are defined by the following criteria: Very common (1<unk> 10), common (1<unk> 100 to <unk> 1<unk> 10), uncommon (1<unk> 1,000 to <unk> 1<unk> 100), rare (1<unk> 10,000 to <unk> 1<unk> 1,000), very rare <unk> <unk> 10,000), unknown (frequency cannot be estimated based on available data).
Within the frequencies, adverse reactions are listed in descending severity.
The following Table 2 shows the frequency of adverse events in clinical trials:

a) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in blood coagulation factor VIIII occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperatively) in a continuous ADVATE infusion patient.
Clotting was maintained throughout and both the factor VIII levels in the plasma and the clearance rate returned to adequate levels on the 15th post-operative day.
After the continuous infusion, tests for factor VIII-inhibitors were carried out and were negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient exhibited low inhibitortiter (2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
Furthermore, in none of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days), an FVIII inhibitor was detected.
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) ADVATE treated patients were inhibitors against factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titer (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The frequency of detection of FVIII inhibitors thus far is in line with expectations and in the range already observed.
s immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by antibody titers to these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 exhibited a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients exhibited sustained peaks or transient peaks.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity occurred.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 exhibited a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients exhibited a sustained peak or transient peak.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to murine IgG.
In four patients, isolated occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes were reported during multiple repeated product exposures.
62 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE has been reported to exhibit allergic type hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency unknown).
Human overdose symptoms with recombinant coagulation factor VIII are not known.
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
The factor VIII/ of Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and of Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions.
ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII (Octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 280 kD.
When Octocog alfa is injected into a haemophilia A patient, it binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor in the bloodstream.
The activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
The activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clotting can occur.
Haemophilia A is a genital, hereditary blood clotting disorder due to decreased Factor VIII-levels.
This results in severe bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
The factors VIII-plasma levels are increased by substitution therapy, whereby a transient correction of the factor VIII-deficiency and the tendency to bleed occurs.
All pharmacokinetics studies of ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
The evaluation of the plasma samples was carried out in a central laboratory using a single-stage clotting test.
The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or <unk> 10 years, are listed in Table 3 below.

If you notice any undesirable effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor.
What is ADVATE and what it is used for?
2. What should you consider before using ADVATE? 3. How should ADVATE be used?
WHAT ADVATE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR?
ADVATE contains Octocog alfa, human coagulation factor VIII, produced by recombinant DNA technology.
Factor VIII is necessary to form clots in the blood to stop bleeding.
In patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII-deficiency) it is missing or not functioning correctly.
ADVATE is used in patients with haemophilia A to prevent or treat spontaneous haemorrhage or bleeding after surgery.
ADVATE is produced without the addition of a human or animal protein during cell culture, purification and final formulation.
WHAT YOU MUST REGARD TO ADVATE BEFORE USE <unk> <unk>
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to Octocog alfa or any of the ingredients
- if you are allergic to mouse or hamster protein.
If in doubt, ask your doctor.
Special caution is necessary when using ADVATE You should tell your doctor if you have recently been treated with Factor VIII-products, especially if you have developed inhibitors.
This increases the risk of recurrence. Inhibitors are neutralising antibodies to factor VIII, which reduce the efficacy of ADVATE in preventing or controlling bleeding.
The development of inhibitors is a known complication of haemophilia A treatment.
If your bleeding cannot be controlled with ADVATE, contact your doctor immediately
There is a small possibility that you will develop an anaphylactic reaction (a sudden, severe, allergic reaction) to ADVATE.
You should be aware of early signs of such
These symptoms may include early signs of anaphylactic shock, which may also include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness, and extreme difficulty breathing.
If any of these symptoms occur, cancel the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe symptoms such as
<unk> <unk> Difficulty breathing and (near fainting) need immediate emergency treatment.
If you are taking other medicines Please tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken them, even if they are non-prescription medicines.
Pregnancy and lactation Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.
Your doctor will decide whether you can use ADVATE in pregnancy and lactation.
ability to drive and use machines ADVATE has no effect on ability to drive and use machines.
Important information about certain excipients of ADVATE This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
This should be taken into account in patients on a sodium restricted diet.
Treatment with ADVATE is initiated by a doctor experienced in the treatment of haemophilia A.
Your doctor will calculate your dose ADVATE (in international units or IU), depending on your physical condition and body weight, and whether it is used to prevent or treat bleeding.
The frequency depends on how well ADVATE works in you.
ADVATE replacement therapy is usually given for life.
Prevention of bleeding The usual dosage with Octocog alfa is 20 -40 IU per kg body weight, administered every 2 -3 days.
However, in some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may be necessary.
Treatment of bleeding The dose of Octocog alfa is determined by body weight and desired factor VIII-levels.
The necessary factor VIII level depends on the severity and site of bleeding.
Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII-increase (% of normal) x 0.5
If you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, tell your doctor.
Your doctor will periodically conduct appropriate laboratory tests to ensure you have adequate factor VIII-levels.
This is especially important for major surgery.
Patients who develop factor VIII inhibitors If the expected factor VIII levels in your plasma are not achieved with ADVATE, or if bleeding cannot be controlled, this may be due to the development of factor VIII
99 inhibitors. Your doctor will check this.
You may need higher doses of ADVATE or even another product to control bleeding.
Do not increase the dosage of ADVATE to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor.
How ADVATE is administered ADVATE is usually administered by the doctor into a vein (intravenously).
If you or someone else administers ADVATE, this should only be done after appropriate training.
At the end of the package leaflet you will find detailed information on self treatment.
If you have used a greater amount of ADVATE than you should, always use ADVATE exactly as your doctor has recommended.
Ask your doctor if you are not sure.
If you have used a large amount, please contact your doctor as soon as possible.
If you have forgotten to use ADVATE Do not inject the double dose if you have missed the previous administration.
Continue with the next scheduled administration immediately as advised by your doctor.
If you discontinue the use of ADVATE, do not discontinue the use of ADVATE without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions about the use of this product, please contact your doctor.
Like all medicines, ADVATE can have side effects, but not necessarily for everyone.
If sudden, severe (anaphylactic) side effects occur, the injection must be discontinued immediately. You must contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early symptoms of allergic (hypersensitive) reactions:

Questions and Answers on the withdrawal of the marketing authorisation application for Advexin
International Freiname (INN): Contusugene Ladenovec
On 17 December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it was withdrawing its application for marketing authorisation for Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.
Advexin was designated an orphan medicinal product on 23 October 2006.
Advexin is an injection suspension containing Contusugene Ladenovec, a genetically modified virus carrying the p53 gene.
What should Advexin be used for?
Advexin should have been used to treat Li-Fraumeni cancer in patients aged 18 years and over.
Li-Fraumeni cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in patients with L-Fraumeni syndrome in whom the so-called p53 gene is defective due to a mutation. People with this mutation are more likely to develop cancer.
Li-Fraumeni cancer can occur in many parts of the body.
However, it usually affects the breast, brain, bones or soft tissues (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body).
The active substance in Advexin, Contusugene Ladenovec, is a viral vector.
It is a type of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.
The virus in Advexin is an adenovirus that has been modified in such a way that it cannot make copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infection in humans.
The gene that the virus carries in Advexin is the normal (not defective) p53 gene.
Advexin should have been injected directly into tumours, enabling cancer cells to reproduce the normal p53 protein.
The p53 protein, which consists of the not defective p53 gene present in the human body, usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to the killing of cells if DNA cannot be recovered.
Since cancer cells contain damaged DNA, the p53 protein helps to restore DNA or causes cells to die.
In Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not function properly and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.
Advexin should have cured the disease or slowed its progression by restoring the normal protective function of the cells.
What documents has the company submitted to CHMP in support of its application?
The effects of Advexin were initially tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The company presented data from a trial in a patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the lower abdomen, bone and brain.
The patient received 12 Advexin injections over five months, which were injected into some of the tumours.

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged.
s efficacy was evaluated by scans, assessing how tumours responded to treatment. Furthermore, the company presented results from several small trials evaluating the effects of a dose range of Advexin in various cancers. At what stage of assessment was the application at the time of withdrawal?
When the company withdrew its application, day 179 was reached in the application procedure.
s replies to the questions put to it, a number of questions were still outstanding.
The CHMP usually takes up to 210 days to evaluate a new application.
On day 120, based on an examination of initial submissions, the CHMP will draw up a list of questions to be sent to the company.
Once the company has provided answers to these questions, they will be considered by the CHMP.
Before the CHMP issues an opinion, it can ask the company any remaining questions on day 180.
What was the CHMP recommendation at that time?
s verified data and replies to CHMP's list of questions, CHMP had some concerns at the time of withdrawal and the Committee's preliminary view was that Advexin could not have been approved for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.
What were the main concerns of the CHMP?
The CHMP considers that there is insufficient evidence that the injection of Advexin into Li-Fraumeni tumours delivers benefits for patients.
The Committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicinal product in the body, the method of administration and safety of the medicinal product.
In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced reliably and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor to people who come into close contact with the patient.
What are the reasons why the company withdrew the application?
The letter informing EMEA of the withdrawal of the application can be found here.
What consequences does the withdrawal have for patients currently participating in clinical trials and / or Compassionate-use programmes with Advexin?
The company did not tell the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or Compassionate-use programs with Advexin.

Aerinaze is a medicinal product containing the active ingredients desloratadine (2.5 mg) and pseudoephedrine (120 mg).
It is available as blue and white altered agent release tablets. Altered agent release means that the tablets are composed so that one of the active ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours.
Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hayfever, nasal tract inflammation caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal swelling (nasal constipation).
This medicinal product is only available on a doctor's prescription.
In adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over, the recommended dose of Aerinaze 2 times daily is a tablet to be taken whole with a glass of water with or without food.
The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and should be stopped as soon as the symptoms, especially swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), have subsided.
A duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the product on nasal constipation may decrease.
Once the nose is clear, patients can take desloratadine alone.
Aerinaze contains two active ingredients:
<unk> <unk> Desloratadine, an antihistamine, and pseudoephedrine, a nasal decongestant.
Desloratadine blocks receptors to which histamine, an endogenous substance that causes allergic symptoms, usually attaches.
When the receptors are blocked, histamine cannot work and this relieves the symptoms of allergy.
Pseudoephedrine stimulates the nerve endings to release the chemical messenger substance noradrenaline, which causes constriction (narrowing) of blood vessels.
This results in less fluid escaping from the vessels, so that the swelling decreases and the nose secretes less mucus.
Aerinaze combines two active ingredients because antihistamines alone often do not sufficiently relieve symptoms in patients with nasal constipation.

( 44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail<unk> emea.europa.eu http<unk> <unk> <unk> www.emea.europa.eu <unk> EMEA 2007 Reproduction and/ or distribution of this document is authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is recognised Aerinaze tablets consist of two layers, one containing desloratadine and the other pseudoephedrine. Desloratadine is released from its layer immediately after administration, while pseudoephedrine is slowly released over 12 hours. Therefore, the tablet only needs to be taken 2 times daily.
The efficacy of Aerinaze was evaluated in two main studies involving a total of 1 248 adult and adolescent patients.
In both studies, Aerinaze was compared with desloratadine alone and with pseudoephedrine alone.
The main efficacy measures were changes in the severity of hayfever symptoms reported by patients prior to commencement of treatment and during 15 days of treatment.
During the study, patients entered their symptoms in a diary every 12 hours and used a standard scale to assess how severe symptoms were in the last 12 hours.
What benefit has Aerinaze shown in these studies?
Aerinaze relieved symptoms more effectively than the two agents alone.
When considering all symptoms of hayfever except nose constipation, patients taking Aerinaze reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms compared to 35.9% for those taking pseudoephedrine alone.
When only nasal swelling was considered, Aerinaze patients exhibited symptom relief of 37.4% compared to 26.7% for those taking desloratadine alone.
In the second study, similar results were observed.
The most common adverse reactions of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart racing), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), pharyngitis (pharyngitis), anorexia (anorexia), constipation, headache, tiredness, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (somnolence), insomnia and nervousness.
See the Package Leaflet for a full list of reported Aerinaze side effects.
<unk> Aerinaze should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, to adrenergic agents or loratadine (another medicinal product used to treat allergies).
It should not be used in patients taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (e. g. some antidepressant medicinal products) or who have stopped taking such a medicinal product within the last two weeks.
Aerinaze should also not be used in patients who suffer from narrow angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), urinary retention (difficult urination), cardiovascular disorders including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidism), or who have already had a haemorrhagic stroke (stroke caused by cerebral haemorrhage) or are at risk of a haemorrhagic stroke.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Aerinaze in the symptomatic treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis with nasal swelling outweigh the risks and recommended authorisation for the marketing of Aerinaze.
On 30 July 2007, the European Commission authorised SP Europe to market Aerinaze throughout the European Union.
The full EPAR for Aerinaze is available here.

Oval tablet with a blue and a white layer, the blue layer is marked with D12.
Symptomatic treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis with accompanying nasal swelling.
Adult and adolescent aged 12 years and over:
The recommended dosage of Aerinaze is one tablet 2 times daily.
The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to be swallowed whole (i. e. without biting, breaking or chewing).
It can be taken independently of meals.
Due to the lack of safety and efficacy data (see section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.
The duration of use should be as short as possible and should not be continued after symptoms subside.
It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine over time.
After decreased swelling of the upper respiratory tract, treatment with desloratadine as monotherapy may be continued.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, any of the excipients, adrenergic agents or loratadine.
Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, it is also contraindicated in patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO<unk> inhibitor) or within 2 weeks of cessation of such therapy.
Aerinaze is also contraindicated in patients with:
<unk> <unk>
- Urinary retention, cardiovascular disorders such as ischaemic heart disease, tachyarrhythmia and severe hypertension, hyperthyroidism, haemorrhagic stroke, or risk factors that may increase the risk of haemorrhagic stroke. This is due to alphamimetic activity associated with the combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolide, lisuride, cabergolin, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, or other decongestants used perorally or nasally as decongestants (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin, etc.).
Do not exceed the recommended dosage and duration of treatment (see section 4.2).
Patients over 60 years of age are more likely to experience adverse events with sympathomimetics such as pseudoephedrine.
The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been evaluated for this population and data are insufficient to recommend appropriate dosage regimens.
Therefore caution should be exercised when using the combination in patients over 60 years of age.
The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze have not been evaluated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and data are insufficient to recommend appropriate dosage regimens.
The combination preparation is not recommended for use in patients with impaired renal or hepatic impairment.
Aerinaze should not be used on children under 12 years of age (see section 4.2).
Patients should be advised that treatment should be discontinued if hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, irregular heart rhythm, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or aggravation of headache) occur.
Sympathomimetic amines can cause central nervous system stimulation with seizure or cardiovascular collapse with hypotension.
These effects are more likely in paediatric, elderly patients or in case of overdose (see section 4.9).
Caution should be exercised when treating the following populations: patients with Digitalis, patients with arrhythmias, patients with hypertension, patients with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, bladder obstruction, or bronchospasm.
Caution should be exercised when using patients with stenosising stomach ulcers and pyloroduodenal obstruction.
Caution should also be exercised in patients receiving other sympathomimetics.
These include: decongestants anorectics or psychostimulants of amphetamine type 3 antihypertensives tricyclic antidepressants and other antihistamines.
In addition, caution should be exercised in patients with migraine who are treated concomitantly with vasoconstricting ergotalkaloids.
Continued use may result in tolerance resulting in an increased risk of overdose.
Use of volatile halogenated anaesthetics during therapy with indirect sympathomimetics may result in perioperative acute hypertension.
Therefore, in the event of surgery, it is preferable to discontinue treatment 24 hours before the start of anaesthesia.
<unk> Athletes should be advised that pseudoephedrine therapy may result in positive doping tests.
<unk> Aerinaze should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological tests, as antihistamines may otherwise prevent or reduce the extent of positive reactions to indicators of skin reaction.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and forms of interaction
However, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in plasma concentrations of desloratadine were observed in clinical trials with additional administration of erythromycin or ketoconazole.
Reversible and irreversible MAOI may increase the risk of vasoconstriction and hypertension.
Co-administration of sympathomimetics may lead to critical hypertonic reactions.
The following concomitant therapies are not recommended: bromocriptin Cabergoline Lisuride, pergolide: risk of vasoconstriction and hypertension.
Dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergometrine: risk of vasoconstriction and hypertension.
Other vasoconstricting agents used orally or nasally as decongestant rhinologic agents (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin, etc.):
Sympathomimetics may reduce the antihypertensive effects of -methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine, veratrum alkaloids and guanethidine.
The absorption rate of pseudoephedrine sulphate is increased by antacids and decreased by kaolin.
The interaction between Aerinaze and alcohol has not been investigated.
In a clinical pharmacological study, the concomitant administration of desloratadine and alcohol increased
4 The results of the psychomotor test did not reveal significant differences between those receiving desloratadine and those receiving placebo, regardless of whether desloratadadine was taken alone or with alcohol.
The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not yet been identified, so interaction with other medicinal products cannot be excluded.
Desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.
In animal studies, neither desloratadine nor the combination of loratadine and pseudoephedrine was teratogenic.
The safety of the use of Aerinaze during pregnancy has not been established, but experience from a large number of affected pregnancies has shown no increase in the frequency of malformations compared to the frequency in the normal population.
Since reproduction studies in animals cannot always be transmitted to humans, and due to the vasoconstrictory characteristics of pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.
Desloratadine and pseudoephedrine are absorbed into breast milk.
Decreased milk production has been reported by nursing mothers in connection with pseudoephedrine.
Therefore, Aerinaze should not be used while breast-feeding.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machinery

No impairment was observed in patients receiving desloratadine in clinical trials assessing ability to drive.
However, patients should be advised that in very rare cases, drowsiness may occur which may result in impairment of ability to drive or use machinery.
Pseudoephedrine sulphate is not expected to affect psychomotor performance.
In clinical trials with 414 adults, the most common adverse events were insomnia (8.9%), dry mouth (7.2%) and headache (3.1%).
These and other adverse events occurring in clinical trials are listed in the table below.
