Open the converting archive.
The contents of an archive can be changed in several ways.
For security reasons, you might want to encrypt the files you want to add to the archive.
If the archive format supports encryption, you can specify a password to encrypt the files you want to add.
Currently only the archive formats 7-ZIP, ZIP, RAR and ARJ support encryption.
Use the following procedure to set a password for the encryption:
How to rename a file in an archive
To rename a file in an archive, use the following procedure:

The size of the compressed archive contents.
The size of the uncompressed archive contents. You can find this information in the statusbar.
The compression level is a value used to describe the reduction in the size of the data. For example, a compression rate of 5 means that the compressed archive will be 1 / 5 the size of the original data.
The name of the file or directory in the archive.
How to view a file from an archive
It might be impossible to decompress a corrupted file, resulting in data loss. For this reason, you should check the integrity of the archive before deleting the original files.
Not all archive types support integrity checking. The following archive types can be integrity checked: 7-Zip, RAR, ZIP, ACE, ARJ, and Zoo.
To check the integrity of an archive whose format does not support integrity checking, decompress all the files in the archive and check if this action has succeeded.

The way from the original position to the target position must be clear, which means you cannot step over other objects.
A straight horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of five or more items will be removed from the tableau. In this case, you will also get one extra move at a time, and no more items will be added to the tableau.
The game is over when the tableau is completely filled, as this will prevent any object from moving.
You score points by forming a line of five or more items. The number of items that you can score depends on the number of.
Try to get at least three equal objects on to the same line with each move.
Try to put more than five objects together. For example, with six objects you can make two lines in sequence with two or three objects each and an empty space in the middle. On the next move, insert the sixth object.

This simulates the extension or shortening of the exposure time.
This setting allows you to adjust the color intensity in an image. Moving to the left decreases the colors, even to the black and white, while moving to the right intensifies the colors.
This adjustment increases the brightness of the colors. Setting it too high will make colors seem washed out, while setting it too low will make the image dark and low in contrast.
This option lets you rotate colors along the color wheel.
This adjustment adjusts the contrast ratio, the difference between the light and dark pixels. Moving it to the left decreases the contrast, while moving it to the right increases the contrast.
This setting changes the color temperature measured in Kelvin.
This setting allows you to tint your photos with a single color.

It involves different kinds of games, such as logic puzzles, calculation tasks, memory exercises, and verbal analogies, all of which are used to test different cognitive abilities.
If you answer the question incorrectly, you receive no points.
If you answer a task correctly, you will score points that depend on both the time it has taken to resolve the problem and whether you have used a hint in the game.
The following table summarizes the different game times (in seconds) depending on your level of difficulty.
Based on the time expected for the selected level of difficulty and the time it will take to complete the exercise, the following logic will be used:
If you go faster than the expected time, you score 10 points.
If you are slower than the expected time, you score 8 points.
If you take more than twice the expected time, you score 7 points.
If you take more than three times the expected time, you score 6 points.
If you use one hint, you get only 80% of the original result.
This means that for an intermediate level of difficulty, in at least 20 games of each type, you need to score 10 points to make the final score of 100 points.
This may sound harsh, but it allows players to compare results from different sessions in the game history and better track their progress through all of the tasks they have completed.
Use the different check boxes below the image to select the results you want to see in the image.
To change the number of saved game sessions or the number of games stored in the history, perform the following steps:
Use the first settings box to change the number of game sessions to be saved, so that the results appear in the history graph for the first time.
The second settings bar lets you change the number of game sessions shown in the history graph.
To change the difficulty of the game, perform the following steps:
Use the clues to solve a riddle.
With some games, simple hints are offered that can be helpful in solving the problem.

Tasks that challenge your reasoning. These riddles are based on sequences of elements, visual and spatial conclusions, or connections between elements.
Tasks that use arithmetic operations to improve your mental arithmetic ability. The player has to combine and use multiplication, division, addition and subtraction in different ways.
Tasks that will put your short term memory to the test. These exercises are collections of objects that the player should remember. Sometimes there is a connection between elements, words, numbers or colors.
Games that test your verbal prowess. These tasks ask you to identify causes and effects, use synonyms or opposites, and check your vocabulary.
To do this, use the following procedure:
Each hour means a rotation of 360 degrees.
There are total <unk> people <unk> people. <unk> brothers <unk> have brothers, <unk> sisters <unk> have sisters and <unk> both <unk> have both. How many people have neither brothers nor sisters?
It is computed by the total number of people minus <unk> brothers <unk> only <unk> people who have only brothers, minus <unk> sisters <unk> only <unk> people who have only sisters, and minus <unk> both <unk> people who have sisters and brothers.
The son of John is now half the age of John minus <unk> difference <unk>, which means (<unk> father <unk> / 2) - <unk> difference <unk>.

Each digit has 8 options. The total number of options is 8 high <unk> digits <unk>.
Each game is an independent event with two possible outcomes. The total number of options is two <unk> games <unk>.
In each encounter there is one player left. Thus the result is: Number of players minus 1.
