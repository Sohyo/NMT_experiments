Pseudoephedrine stimulates the nerve endings to release the chemical messenger substance noradrenaline, which causes constriction (narrowing) of blood vessels.

It inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, i. e. cells involved in the breakdown of bone tissue. By blocking the activity of these cells, alendronate slows bone loss. Vitamin D3 is a nutrient found in some foods, but is also produced in the skin when exposed to natural sunlight. Vitamin D3, like other forms of vitamin D, is necessary for calcium uptake and normal bone formation. As patients with osteoporosis may not produce enough vitamin D3 from exposure to the sun, the vitamin is included in ADROVANCE.

Therefore, in a main study involving 111 patients with haemophilia A, Advate was compared with Recombinate to show that both medicinal products are equivalent. In addition, the number of bleeding episodes in 107 patients receiving all Advate was evaluated and the efficacy of Advate in haemostasis was evaluated on a scale from ineffective to excellent. Three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a trial involving 53 children under six years of age, investigated the use of the product for haematological prevention and surgery.
