In addition, the company had not supplied enough evidence to demonstrate that Advexin could be made in a reliable manner, or that it would not be harmful to the environment or to people in close contact with the patient.
ADVATE does not contain von Willebrand Factor in pharmacologically effective quantities and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand disease.
In Aerinaze, the two active substances are used together, since an antihistamine alone may not provide adequate relief for patients with nasal congestion.
Because alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in authorised medicines in the European Union, the company presented data obtained in earlier studies and from the published literature.
Although no clinical information is available, it is likely that, as in animals, elimination of alendronate via the kidney will be reduced in patients with impaired renal function.
Posology The posology and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient s clinical condition.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections.

The most common side effects with Adenuric (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are headache, diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), rash and abnormal liver test results.
In Aerinaze werden zwei arzneilich wirksame Bestandteile kombiniert, weil ein Antihistaminikum allein bei Patienten mit Verstopfung der Nase häufig keine ausreichende Linderung der Symptome bewirkt. This means that patients only need to take the tablet twice a day.
2 Die Patienten sollen sich nach Einnahme von ADROVANCE mindestens 30 Minuten nicht hinlegen. ADROVANCE soll nicht vor dem Schlafengehen oder vor dem ersten Aufstehen des Tages eingenommen werden. 2 ADROVANCE should not be taken at bedtime or before arising for the day.

Distribution Studies in rats show that alendronate transiently distributes to soft tissues following 1 mg/ kg intravenous administration but is then rapidly redistributed to bone or excreted in the urine.
However, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in desloratadine plasma concentrations were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered.

Adenuric usually reduces blood uric acid levels within two weeks, but the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day if blood uric acid levels remain above 6 mg per decilitre after two to four weeks.
As Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, it is also contraindicated in patients who are receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy or during the 2 weeks following the stopping of such treatment.

How has Adenuric been studied?
Der Ausschuss für Humanarzneimittel (CHMP) gelangte zu dem Schluss, dass die Vorteile von Advate bei der Behandlung und Propyhlaxe von Blutungen bei Patienten mit Hämophilie A (angeborener Mangel an Faktor VIII) gegenüber den Risiken überwiegen, und empfahl, die Genehmigung für das Inverkehrbringen von Advate zu erteilen. The Committee recommended that Advate be given marketing authorisation.
The first study, carried out in 1,072 patients, compared the effectiveness of three doses of Adenuric (80, 120 and 240 mg once a day) with that of placebo (a dummy treatment) and of allopurinol (another medicine used to treat hyperuricaemia).
How far into the evaluation was the application when it was withdrawn?
Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.
Colecalciferol Vitamin D3 may increase the magnitude of hypercalcaemia and/ or hypercalciuria when administered to patients with disease associated with unregulated overproduction of calcitriol (e. g. leukaemia, lymphoma, sarcoidosis).

In the first study, 48% of the patients taking 80 mg Adenuric once a day (126 out of 262) and 65% of the patients taking 120 mg once a day (175 out of 269) had levels of uric acid below 6 mg/ dl in the final three measurements.
