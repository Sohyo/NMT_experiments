Biotransformation Vitamin D3 is rapidly hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and then metabolised in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the biologically active form.
Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors If the expected factor VIII levels in your plasma are not achieved with ADVATE, or if haemorrhage cannot be controlled, this may be related to the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
Patients in the 2,800 IU vitamin D3 group received ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n/ 299) and patients in the 5,600 IU vitamin D3 group received ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) and an additional 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 (n/ 309) once a week; additional vitamin D supplements were allowed; after 24 weeks of treatment, mean serum levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher in the 5,600 IU vitamin D3 group (69 nmol/ 27.6 ng/ ml) than in the 2,800 IU vitamin D3 group (64 nmol/ 25.5 ng/ ml).

It inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, cells involved in the breakdown of bone tissue. By blocking the activity of these cells, alendronate slows down bone loss. Vitamin D3 is a nutrient found in some foods but also produced in the skin when exposed to natural sunlight. Vitamin D3, like other forms of vitamin D, is required for calcium uptake and normal bone formation and since patients with osteoporosis may not produce enough vitamin D3 from the sun, it is included in ADROVANCE.

Therefore, in a main study in 111 patients who suffer from haemophilia A, Advate was compared to Recombinate to show that both medicines are equivalent; the study also looked at the number of episodes of bleeding in 107 patients who received all of Advate, and assessed the effectiveness of Advate in haemostasis on a scale from ineffective to excellent; and in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study in 53 children under six years of age, the use of the medicine to prevent haemorrhage and for surgery was examined.
