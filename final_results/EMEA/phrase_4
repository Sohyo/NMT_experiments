Adenuric is a medicinal product containing the active substance Febuxostat.
It is available as yellow capsule tablets (80 and 120 mg).
Adenuric is used to treat chronic (long-term) hyperuricaemia (high levels of uric acid and urate in the blood).
In hyperuricaemia, urine crystals may form and deposit in the joints and kidneys.
When such deposits form in the joints and cause pain, it is called gout.
Adenuric is used in patients who already show signs of crystal deposits, including arthritis (pain and inflammation in the joints) or rheumatoid nodules (stones i. e. larger urine crystal deposits that can cause joint and bone damage).
This medicinal product is available only on prescription.
The recommended dose of Adenuric is 80 mg once daily.
It may be taken with or without meals.
Adenuric lowers uric acid levels in the blood usually within two weeks. If uric acid levels remain above 6 mg per deciliter after two to four weeks, the dose may be increased to 120 mg once daily.
Attacks of gout can still occur during the first few months of treatment, and it is therefore recommended that patients take other medicines to prevent gout during at least the first six months of treatment with Adenuric.
Treatment with Adenuric should not be discontinued if an attack of gout occurs.
The efficacy and safety of Adenuric have not been evaluated in patients with severe renal or liver problems.
This medicine is not recommended in paediatric and organ transplant patients as it has not been evaluated for these groups.
The active substance feboxustat in Adenuric decreases the formation of uric acid.
It works by inhibiting an enzyme called xanthine oxidase, which is necessary for uric acid production in the body.
By decreasing uric acid production, Adenuric may

lower uric acid levels in the blood and maintain them at a lower level so that no crystals can form, thus relieving symptoms of gout. If uric acid levels are maintained at a low level for long enough, even existing gout nodes may become smaller. How has Adenuric been investigated?
The effects of Adenuric were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The efficacy of Adenuric was evaluated in two main studies involving a total of 1 834 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout.
In the first trial involving 1,072 patients, the efficacy of three different adenuric doses (80, 120, and 240 mg once daily) was compared with placebo (sham) and allopurinol (another hyperuricaemia medicine).
In the second trial, two doses of Adenuric (80 and 120 mg once daily) were compared for one year in 762 patients, each with allopurinol.
In both trials, allopurinol was given at a once-daily dose of 300 mg; patients with renal problems received only 100 mg per day.
The main measure of efficacy was the number of patients whose blood uric acid levels were below 6 mg/ dl in the last three measurements.
The uric acid level in the blood was determined each month.
What benefit has Adenuric shown in these studies?
Adenuric was more effective in lowering uric acid levels in the blood than allopurinol and placebo.
In the first trial, 48% (126 out of 262) of those taking 80 mg once daily of adenuric and 65% (175 out of 269) of those taking 120 mg once daily had uric acid levels below 6 mg/ dl in their blood on the last three measurements.
This compared to 22% (60 out of 268) of those receiving allopurinol and none of the 134 receiving placebo.
The second trial yielded similar results after one year.
The most common adverse reactions of Adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, diarrhoea, nausea, rash and abnormal liver enzymes.
Especially in patients with a history of heart problems, there may also be an increased risk of certain cardiac and vascular side effects.
For a full list of adverse reactions reported with Adenuric, see the Package Leaflet.
Adenuric should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to feboxustat or any of the ingredients.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that while Adenuric was more effective at lowering uric acid levels in the blood than allopurinol, it could also increase the risk of heart and vascular adverse reactions.
The Committee concluded that the benefits of Adenuric in the treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia outweigh the risks when urine deposits have already occurred and recommended that marketing authorisation be granted for Adenuric.
On 21 April 2008, the European Commission authorised Adenuric to be marketed throughout the European Union.
The marketing authorisation holder is Beaufour Ipsen Pharma.

ADROVANCE is a white capsule tablet containing two active ingredients: sodium alendronate 3 H2O (70 mg) and colecalciferol (vitamin D3, 70 micrograms equivalent to 2800 international units IU).
This medicine is identical to FOSAVANCE, which is already authorised in the European Union.
The manufacturer of FOSAVANCE has agreed that the scientific data on this product may also be used for ADROVANCE.
ADROVANCE is used to treat osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become fragile) in post-menopausal women who are at risk for low D levels.
ADROVANCE reduces the risk of spinal and hip fractures (fractures).
This medicinal product is available only on prescription.
The recommended dose is one tablet once weekly.
The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).
In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient should not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should not be earlier than 30 minutes after taking the tablet.
Do not chew or dissolve in the mouth.
Patients should also take additional calcium if food intake is insufficient.
For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
Bone is a living tissue that is constantly renewed by breaking down old bone and replacing it with new.
Osteoporosis is a condition in which the bones gradually become thin and fragile, resulting in increased susceptibility to fractures (fractures).
This occurs when not enough new bone tissue grows to replace the naturally broken down bone.
osteoporosis primarily occurs in post-menopausal women (after 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

ADROVANCE contains active ingredients alendronate and vitamin D3.
Alendronate is a biphosphonate used since the mid 1990s to treat osteoporosis.
Alendronate inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, cells involved in the breakdown of bone tissue. By blocking the activity of these cells, alendronate slows bone loss. Vitamin D3 is a nutrient found in some foods but also produced in the skin when exposed to natural sunlight. Vitamin D3, like other forms of vitamin D, is needed for calcium uptake and normal bone formation. As patients with osteoporosis may not produce enough vitamin D3 from sunlight, ADROVANCE contains it.
Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicinal products authorised in the European Union, the company presented data from previous studies and published literature.
The company also conducted a trial in 35 men and 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis to demonstrate ADROVANCE's efficacy in increasing D levels.
Patients received either ADROVANCE or alendronate once a week.
The main measure of efficacy was the percentage of patients with low D levels.
What benefit has ADROVANCE shown in these studies?
Following 15 weeks of treatment, patients receiving ADROVANCE with low D levels had a lower proportion (11%) than those receiving alendronate alone (32%).
The company also presented data showing that the alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.
The most common adverse reactions (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and digestive system symptoms such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (indigestion), constipation, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (flatulence), ulcers (oesophagus), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), bloated abdomen (bloated abdomen) and acid regurgitation.
See the Package Leaflet for a full list of reported adverse reactions associated with ADROVANCE.
In patients with possible hypersensitivity (allergy) to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the ingredients, ADROVANCE should not be used.
Do not use in oesophageal disorders, in patients with hypocalcaemia (low calcium), or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that the benefits of ADROVANCE in the treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal patients at risk of vitamin D deficiency outweigh the risks and recommended authorisation for the marketing of ADROVANCE.
On 4 January 2007, the European Commission authorised Merck Sharp <unk> Dohme Ltd to market ADROVANCE throughout the European Union.
The full EPAR for ADROVANCE is available here.
Each tablet contains 70 mg alendronic acid as sodium alendronate 3 H2O and 70 micrograms (2,800 IU) colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Each tablet contains 62 mg lactose and 8 mg sucrose.
For a full list of other ingredients, see section 6.1.

therapy of post-menopausal osteoporosis in patients at risk of vitamin D deficiency.
ADROVANCE reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.
The recommended dose is one ADROVANCE tablet weekly.
In view of the course of osteoporosis, ADROVANCE is intended for long-term therapy.
Notes to ensure adequate absorption of alendronate include
ADROVANCE should be taken only with water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before your first meal, drink or take medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.
Other beverages (including mineral water), foods and some medicines may affect the absorption of alendronate (see section 4.5).
The following advice should be followed closely to reduce the risk of oesophageal irritation and associated side effects (see section 4.4):
ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after waking up each day. Patients should not chew or allow the tablet to melt in their mouth as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcers. Patients should not lie down before their first food intake of the day, which should be 30 minutes after taking the tablet at the earliest.
2 Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking ADROVANCE. ADROVANCE should not be taken before bed or before getting up for the first time.
Patients should be supplemented with calcium if food is not sufficient (see section 4.4).
Additional vitamin D supplementation should be considered individually, taking into account vitamin D uptake by vitamin supplements and supplements.
The equivalent of taking 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 once a week in ADROVANCE and 400 IU of vitamin D once a day has not been investigated.
In clinical trials, there was no age-related difference in the efficacy or safety profile of alendronate.
Dosage adjustment in elderly patients is therefore not necessary.
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 35 ml/ min.
ADROVANCE is not recommended in patients with impaired renal function with a GFR below 35 ml/ min due to lack of experience.
ADROVANCE has not been studied in children and adolescents and should therefore not be used in them.
Hypersensitivity to any active substance or ingredients. Oesophagus disorders and other factors that delay oesophageal emptying, such as stricture or achalasia. Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes. Hypocalcaemia.
Alendronate Alendronate may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosae.
Due to the possible worsening of the underlying condition, alendronate should be given with caution in patients with active gastro-intestinal disorders, such as dysphagia, oesophagus disorders, gastritis, duodenitis, ulcers, or with recent (within the last year), severe gastro-intestinal disorders, such as peptic ulcer, active gastro-intestinal bleeding or upper gastro-intestinal surgery other than pyloroplasty (see section 4.3).
Oesophageal reactions such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosion, rarely followed by oesophageal stricture, were reported in patients taking alendronate (some of these were severe and required hospitalization).
The doctor should therefore be attentive to all signs and symptoms indicating possible oesophageal reaction and patients should be advised to discontinue the product and seek medical advice if symptoms of oesophageal irritation such as dysphagia, swallowing pain or retrostatic pain or new or worsening heartburn occur (see section 4.8).
The risk of severe oesophageal adverse events appears to be increased in patients who are not taking the medicine<unk> or who continue to take it after symptoms indicating oesophageal irritation have occurred.
It is very important that all dosage instructions are communicated to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).
Patients should be advised that failure to follow these instructions may result in an increased risk of oesophageal problems.
While large-scale clinical trials of alendronate have not shown an increased risk, gastric and duodenal ulcers, some severe and with complications, have rarely been reported (see section 4.8).
jaw osteonecrosis, usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose regimens primarily include intravenous bisphosphonates.
Many of these patients also received chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
jaw osteonecrosis has also been reported in osteoporosis patients receiving oral bisphosphonates.
A dental examination with appropriate preventive measures should be preceded by treatment with bisphosphonates if patients exhibit corresponding risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, periodontitis).
During treatment, these patients should avoid maxillofacial surgery as far as possible.
If patients develop osteonecrosis of the jaw during bisphosphonate therapy, orthodontic surgery may result in worsening of the condition.
No data are available to indicate whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy in patients requiring maxillofacial surgery reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
The clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient on the basis of an individual benefit-risk assessment.
bone, joint, or muscle pain have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates.
Following marketing, these symptoms were rarely severe and/ or associated with impairment of mobility (see section 4.8).
The timing of onset of these symptoms varied from one day to several months after initiation of therapy.
In most patients, discomfort decreased after discontinuation of therapy.
In some patients, symptoms recurred when resumed therapy with the same medicine or another bisphosphonate.
Patients should be advised that if they fail to take a dose of ADROVANCE, they should take the tablet the next morning after noticing their failure.
Do not take two tablets on the same day, but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the designated day of the week.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for renal failure patients with GFR below 35 ml/ min (see section 4.2).
Other possible causes of osteoporosis besides oestrogen deficiency and age should be considered.
Existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected before ADROVANCE therapy is initiated (see section 4.3).
Other disorders that affect mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with ADROVANCE.
The D vitamin content of ADROVANCE is not suitable for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency.
Patients with these disorders should be monitored for serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcaemia when receiving ADROVANCE.
Due to bone mineralization stimulation by alendronate, decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur.
However, rare cases of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, some severe, were reported, often in patients with appropriate predisposing factors (e. g. hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption) (see section 4.8).
Colecalciferol Vitamin D3 may increase the extent of hypercalcaemia and/ or hypercalciuria when administered in patients with disorders associated with uncontrolled overproduction of calcitriol (e. g. leukaemia, lymphoma, sarcoidosis).
In these patients urine and serum calcium should be monitored.
Malabsorption patients may not be receiving adequate vitamin D3.
Other ingredients This medicinal product contains lactose and sucrose.
Patients with rare hereditary fructose intolerance, galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other interactions
Alendronate Foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.
Patients should therefore wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking other medicines (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
No other clinically relevant interactions with medicines are expected.
In clinical trials, several patients received estrogen (intravaginal, transdermal or oral) in conjunction with alendronate.
No adverse reactions resulting from this combined use were observed.
Although no specific interaction studies have been conducted, alendronate has been used in clinical trials alongside a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions.
cholestyramine, colestipol) may impair the absorption of vitamin D.
Anticonvulsants, cimetidine and thiazides can increase the metabolism of vitamin D.
Additional vitamin D supplementation should be considered individually.
ADROVANCE is designed only for use in post-menopausal women and should therefore not be used during pregnancy or by nursing women.
There are no adequate data on the use of ADROVANCE in pregnant women.
Animal studies of alendronate show no evidence of direct adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic or postnatal development.
Alendronate given to pregnant rats caused dystocia associated with hypocalcaemia (see section 5.3).
Animal studies at high doses of vitamin D have shown hypercalcaemia and reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Alendronate is not known to be metabolised into breast milk.
Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites are released into breast milk.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies have been carried out on ability to drive or use machines.
However, there is no information to suggest that ADROVANCE impairs the ability to drive or use machines.
The following adverse reactions were reported during clinical trials and/ or after the marketing of alendronate.
No other undesirable effects were observed for ADROVANCE.
Common (1<unk> 100, <unk> 1<unk> 10), occasional (1<unk> 1,000, <unk> 1<unk> 100), rare (1<unk> 10,000, <unk> 1<unk> 1,000), very rare (<unk> 1<unk> 10,000) <unk>
Common: abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, oesophageal ulcus*, dysphagia*, distended abdomen, acid regurgitation. Uncommon: nausea, vomiting, gastritis, oesophagitis*, oesophageal erosion*, melena. Rare: oesophagus stricture *, oropharyngeal ulceration*, perforations, ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (see section 4.4<unk>. * See sections 4.2 and 4.4.
rash, pruritus, erythema. Rare: rash with photosensitivity. Very rare: severe skin reactions including Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Common: musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain.
Rare: severe musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain (see section 4.4).
Rare: symptomatic hypocalcaemia, usually in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (see section 4.4).
Rare: transient symptoms of acute phase reaction (myalgia, discomfort and rare fever), usually at the onset of therapy.
Following reactions have been reported (frequency unknown):
jaw osteonecrosis has been reported in bisphosphonate patients; most reports have been from cancer patients, but osteoporosis patients have also been reported.
jaw osteonecrosis is usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis).
Cancer diagnosis, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also considered risk factors (see section 4.4).
In clinical trials, asymptomatic, mild, and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18% and 10% of those taking alendronate 10 mg/ day, respectively, compared to approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo.
However, decreases in serum calcium to <unk> 8.0 mg/ dl (2.0 mmol/ l) and serum phosphate to 2.0 mg/ dl (0.65 mmol/ l) occurred with a similar frequency in both treatment arms.
Oral overdose may result in hypocalcaemia, hypophosphatemia and upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as upset stomach, heartburn, oesophagitis, gastritis or ulcers.
No specific experience exists in the treatment of alendronate overdose.
In case of an overdose with ADROVANCE, milk or antacids should be given to bind alendronate.
Due to the risk of oesophageal irritation, no vomiting measures should be taken and the patient should remain upright.
Colecalciferol No vitamin D toxicity has been documented for doses of less than 10,000 IU / day In a clinical trial in healthy adults, a daily dose of 4,000 IU
vitamin D3 for up to 5 months is not associated with hypercalciuria or hypercalcaemia.
ADROVANCE is a combination tablet with the active ingredients sodium alendronate 3 H2O and colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Alendronate Sodium alendronate 3 H2O is a bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts without exerting a direct effect on bone formation.
Preclinical studies have shown that alendronate is preferred at sites of active absorption
7. Osteoclastic activity is inhibited, but osteoclastic recruitment and attachment are not affected.
The bone formed during alendronate therapy is of normal quality.
Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the conversion of 7 -dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3.
In cases of insufficient sunlight, it is essential that vitamin D3 is a component of food.
Vitamin D3 is converted into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the liver and stored until it is needed.
Conversion to the active calcium mobilising hormone 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) in the kidney is strictly regulated.
The main effect of 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and to regulate serum calcium, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.
vitamin D3 is necessary for normal bone formation.
D deficiency occurs when insufficient exposure to the sun and food intake.
Deficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, bone loss, and an increased risk of skeletal fractures.
In severe cases, deficiency may lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphatemia, proximal muscle weakness and osteomalacia, and thus to a further increased risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic subjects.
Vitamin D supplementation reduces these risks and their consequences.
bone mineral density) in the spine or hip that is 2.5 standard deviations below the mean for a normal, young population, or regardless of bone density as a pathological fracture.
trials of ADROVANCE The effect of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronate<unk> 2,800 IU of vitamin D3) on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15-week, multinational trial in 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis (mean serum baseline of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D: 56 nmol/ l <unk> 22.3 ng/ ml; range: 22.5 -225 nmol/ l <unk> 9 -90 ng/ ml <unk>).
Patients were receiving lower strength ADROVANCE (70 mg / 2,800 IU) (n/ 350) or FOSAMAX (alendronate) 70 mg once weekly (n/ 332), with no other vitamin D supplements.
After 15 weeks of treatment, mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher (26%) in the ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (56 nmol/ 23 ng/ ml) group than in the alendronate alone group (46 nmol/ l / 18.2 ng/ ml).
ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) significantly decreased the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <unk> 37.5 nmol/ <unk> 15 ng/ ml <unk>) by 62.5% compared to alendronate alone (12% vs.
32%).
ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <unk> 22.5 nmol/ l <unk> 9 ng/ ml <unk>) by 92% compared to alendronate alone (1% vs. 13%).
In this trial, after 15 weeks, mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in vitamin D deficient patients increased from 30 nmol/ l (12.1 ng/ ml) to 40 nmol/ l (15.9 ng/ ml) in the ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n/ 75) group and decreased from 30 nmol/ l (12.0 ng/ ml) at the start of the trial to 26 nmol/ l (10.4 ng/ ml) in the alendronate alone (n/ 70) group.
There were no differences between the treatment groups with regard to the mean values of serum calcium, phosphate or calcium in 24-hour urine.
trials of alendronate The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate once weekly 70 mg (n/ 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n/ 370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicentre trial in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.
Elevations above baseline lumbar BMD were 5.1% (95% CI:
4.8, 5.4%) in the 70 mg weekly and 5.4% (95% CI:
5.0, 5.8%) in the 10 mg daily group.
Mean BMD increases were 2.3% and 2.9% for the femoral neck and 2.9% and 3.1% for the entire hip, respectively, in the 70 mg weekly and 10 mg daily groups.
8 treatment groups were also comparable in BMD increases at other skeletal sites.
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were investigated in two identical design Phase II (n/ 944) and Fracture Intervention (FIT: n/ 6,459) studies.
In the Phase III-1 trials, mean increases in BMD with alendronate were 10 mg/ day versus placebo at 3 years, 8.8% in the spine, 5.9% in the femoral neck, and 7.8% in the trochanter.
The BMD of the total skeleton also increased significantly.
In the alendronate treated group, a 48% reduction (alendronate 3.2% vs. placebo 6.2%) was achieved in the proportion of patients who sustained one or more vertebral fractures compared to the placebo group.
Throughout the two year extension of these studies, spinal and trochanter BMD continued to rise and femoral and body BMD was maintained.
FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled studies in which alendronate was given daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and subsequently 10 mg daily for either 1 or 2 years):
FIT 1: a three-year trial of 2,027 patients with at least one pre-existing vertebral compression fracture.
In this study, daily alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% vs. placebo 15.0%).
In addition, a significant reduction in the incidence of hip fractures (1.1% vs. 2.2%; reduction of 51%) was observed.
FIT 2: a four year trial of 4,432 patients with low bone mass but without pre-existing vertebral fracture.
In this study, a significant difference in the incidence of hip fractures (alendronate 1.0% vs. placebo 2.2%; reduction of 56%) and in the incidence of at least one vertebral fracture (2.9% vs. 5.8%; reduction of 50%) was observed in analysis of the subgroup of osteoporotic women (37% of the total number suffering from osteoporosis as defined above).
Regarding intravenous reference dose, mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nocturnal fasting and two hours prior to standardized breakfast.
The bioavailability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% when alendronate was taken one or half an hour prior to a standardized breakfast.
In osteoporosis studies, alendronate was effective when taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.
The alendronate compound of the ADROVANCE combination tablet (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) and the 70 mg alendronate tablet are bioequivalent.
Bioavailability was minimal when alendronate was used with or up to two hours after a standardized breakfast.
Taking alendronate concomitantly with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60%.
In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg 3 times daily for five days) did not result in a clinically important change in oral bioavailability of alendronate (mean increase in the 20% to 44% range).
Distribution Studies in rats have shown that alendronate temporarily distributes into soft tissue after the intravenous administration of 1 mg/ kg, but is then rapidly redistributed to the bone or excreted in the urine.
The mean steady-state volume of the distribution is at least 28 litres in humans, excluding bones.
Plasma concentrations after oral therapeutic doses of alendronate are too low for analytical detection (<unk> 5 ng/ ml).
The protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78 <unk>.
biotransformation There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolised in animals or humans.
After the intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C-alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactively labelled substance was excreted within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was detected in the faeces.
After the intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml/ min and the systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml/ min.
plasma concentrations decreased by more than 95% within six hours after intravenous administration.
The human terminal half-life is estimated at over ten years, taking into account the release of alendronate from the skeleton.
In rats, alendronate is not excreted via the acidic or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and is therefore not thought to affect the excretion of other medicines by these transport systems in humans.
Absorption In healthy adult subjects (women and men) after nocturnal fasting and two hours before meal intake, the mean surface area below the serum concentration time curve (AUC0-120 h) for vitamin D3 was 296.4 ng h/ ml (excluding endogenous vitamin D3 levels).
The mean maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of vitamin D3 was 5.9 ng/ ml and the median time to reach peak serum concentration (Tmax) was 12 hours.
The bioavailability of 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 in ADROVANCE is comparable to that of 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 alone.
Distribution After absorption, vitamin D3 is absorbed into the blood as a component of chylomicrons.
Vitamin D3 is rapidly distributed, primarily to the liver, where it is metabolised into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the main store.
Smaller amounts are distributed in fat and muscle tissue and are stored there as vitamin D3 before being released into the circulation.
Circulating vitamin D3 is bound to vitamin D binding protein.
biotransformation Vitamin D3 is rapidly hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and then metabolised in the kidney to 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the biologically active form.
Further hydroxylation occurs prior to excretion.
A small amount of vitamin D3 is glucuronised prior to excretion.
When radioactively labelled vitamin D3 was administered to healthy subjects, the mean level of radioactivity in the urine was 2.4% after 48 hours, and 4.9% in the faeces after 4 days.
In both cases, radioactivity was excreted almost exclusively as metabolites of the starting substance.
The mean half-life of vitamin D3 in serum is approximately 24 hours after an oral dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU).
Characteristics in patients Preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate not deposited in the bone is rapidly excreted via urine.
No evidence of bone absorption saturation after long-term doses ranging from cumulative intravenous doses to
10 35 mg/ kg in animals. Although no clinical data are available, renal elimination of alendronate is expected to be reduced in patients with impaired renal function, as in animal studies.
Patients with impaired renal function are therefore expected to experience slightly increased accumulation of alendronate in bone (see section 4.2).
No non-clinical trials of the combination of alendronate and colecalciferol were conducted.
Alendronate Non-clinical data based on conventional safety, chronic toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential studies show no particular human risk.
Studies in rats showed that administration of alendronate to pregnant rats was associated with the occurrence of mother dystocia due to hypocalcaemia.
In studies, high doses in rats caused an increased occurrence of incomplete ossification in the fetus.
The significance of this observation for humans is unknown.
Colecalciferol In animal studies, reproductive toxicity effects were observed at doses far greater than the therapeutic dose in humans.

Treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in patients at risk for vitamin D deficiency who are not receiving additional vitamin D supplementation.
ADROVANCE reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.
The recommended dose is one ADROVANCE tablet weekly.
In view of the course of osteoporosis, ADROVANCE is intended for long-term therapy.
Notes to ensure adequate absorption of alendronate include
ADROVANCE should be taken only with water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before your first meal, drink or take medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.
Other beverages (including mineral water), foods and some medicines may affect the absorption of alendronate (see section 4.5).
The following advice should be followed closely to reduce the risk of oesophageal irritation and associated side effects (see section 4.4):
ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after waking up each day. Patients should not chew or allow the tablet to melt in their mouth as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcers. Patients should not lie down before their first food intake of the day, which should be 30 minutes after taking the tablet at the earliest.
Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking ADROVANCE. ADROVANCE should not be taken before bed or before getting up for the first time.
Patients should be supplemented with calcium if food is not sufficient (see section 4.4).
The equivalent of taking 5,600 IU
vitamin D3 once a week in ADROVANCE and 800 IU
vitamin D supplementation once a day has not been investigated.
In clinical trials, there was no age-related difference in the efficacy or safety profile of alendronate.
Dosage adjustment in elderly patients is therefore not necessary.
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 35 ml/ min.
ADROVANCE is not recommended in patients with impaired renal function with a GFR below 35 ml/ min due to lack of experience.
ADROVANCE has not been studied in children and adolescents and should therefore not be used in them.
Hypersensitivity to any active substance or ingredients. Oesophagus disorders and other factors that delay oesophageal emptying, such as stricture or achalasia. Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes. Hypocalcaemia.
Alendronate Alendronate may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosae.
Due to the possible worsening of the underlying condition, alendronate should be given with caution in patients with active gastro-intestinal disorders, such as dysphagia, oesophagus disorders, gastritis, duodenitis, ulcers, or with recent (within the last year), severe gastro-intestinal disorders, such as peptic ulcer, active gastro-intestinal bleeding or upper gastro-intestinal surgery other than pyloroplasty (see section 4.3).
Oesophageal reactions such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosion, rarely followed by oesophageal stricture, were reported in patients taking alendronate (some of these were severe and required hospitalization).
The doctor should therefore be attentive to all signs and symptoms indicating possible oesophageal reaction and patients should be advised to discontinue the product and seek medical advice if symptoms of oesophageal irritation such as dysphagia, swallowing pain or retrostatic pain or new or worsening heartburn occur (see section 4.8).
The risk of severe oesophageal adverse events appears to be increased in patients who are not taking the medicine correctly and / or who continue to take it after symptoms indicating oesophageal irritation have occurred.
It is very important that all dosage instructions are communicated to the patient and understood by the patient
patients should be advised that failure to follow these instructions may result in an increased risk of oesophageal problems.
While large-scale clinical trials of alendronate have not shown an increased risk, gastric and duodenal ulcers, some severe and with complications, have rarely been reported (see section 4.8).
jaw osteonecrosis, usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose regimens primarily include intravenous bisphosphonates.
Many of these patients also received chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
jaw osteonecrosis has also been reported in osteoporosis patients receiving oral bisphosphonates.
A dental examination with appropriate preventive measures should be preceded by treatment with bisphosphonates if patients exhibit corresponding risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, periodontitis).
During treatment, these patients should avoid maxillofacial surgery as far as possible.
If patients develop osteonecrosis of the jaw during bisphosphonate therapy, orthodontic surgery may result in worsening of the condition.
No data are available to indicate whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy in patients requiring maxillofacial surgery reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
The clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient on the basis of an individual benefit-risk assessment.
bone, joint, or muscle pain have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates.
Following marketing, these symptoms were rarely severe and/ or associated with impairment of mobility (see section 4.8).
The timing of onset of these symptoms varied from one day to several months after initiation of therapy.
In most patients, discomfort decreased after discontinuation of therapy.
In some patients, symptoms recurred when resumed therapy with the same medicine or another bisphosphonate.
Patients should be advised that if they fail to take a dose of ADROVANCE, they should take the tablet the next morning after noticing their failure.
Do not take two tablets on the same day, but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the designated day of the week.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for renal failure patients with GFR below 35 ml/ min (see section 4.2).
Other possible causes of osteoporosis besides oestrogen deficiency and age should be considered.
Existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected before ADROVANCE therapy is initiated (see section 4.3).
Other disorders that affect mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with ADROVANCE.
The D vitamin content of ADROVANCE is not suitable for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency.
Patients with these disorders should be monitored for serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcaemia when receiving ADROVANCE.
Due to the stimulation of bone mineralisation by alendronate, decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur.
However, rare cases of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, some severe even 15, were reported, often in patients with appropriate predisposing factors (e. g. hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption) (see section 4.8).
Colecalciferol Vitamin D3 may increase the extent of hypercalcaemia and/ or hypercalciuria when administered in patients with disorders associated with uncontrolled overproduction of calcitriol (e. g. leukaemia, lymphoma, sarcoidosis).
In these patients urine and serum calcium should be monitored.
Malabsorption patients may not be receiving adequate vitamin D3.
Other ingredients This medicinal product contains lactose and sucrose.
Patients with rare hereditary fructose intolerance, galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other interactions
Alendronate Foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.
Patients should therefore wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking other medicines (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
No other clinically relevant interactions with medicines are expected.
In clinical trials, several patients received estrogen (intravaginal, transdermal or oral) in conjunction with alendronate.
No adverse reactions resulting from this combined use were observed.
Although no specific interaction studies have been conducted, alendronate has been used in clinical trials alongside a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions.
cholestyramine, colestipol) may impair the absorption of vitamin D.
Anticonvulsants, cimetidine and thiazides can increase the metabolism of vitamin D.
Additional vitamin D supplementation should be considered individually.
ADROVANCE is designed only for use in post-menopausal women and should therefore not be used during pregnancy or by nursing women.
There are no adequate data on the use of ADROVANCE in pregnant women.
Animal studies of alendronate show no evidence of direct adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic or postnatal development.
Alendronate given to pregnant rats caused dystocia associated with hypocalcaemia (see section 5.3).
Animal studies at high doses of vitamin D have shown hypercalcaemia and reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
It is not known whether alendronate is absorbed into breast milk.
Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites are released into breast milk.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies have been carried out on ability to drive or use machines.
However, there is no information to suggest that ADROVANCE impairs the ability to drive or use machines.
The following adverse reactions were reported during clinical trials and/ or after the marketing of alendronate.
No other undesirable effects were observed for ADROVANCE.
Common (1<unk> 100, <unk> 1<unk> 10), occasional (1<unk> 1,000, <unk> 1<unk> 100), rare (1<unk> 10,000, <unk> 1<unk> 1,000), very rare (<unk> 1<unk> 10,000) <unk>
Common: abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, oesophageal ulcus*, dysphagia*, distended abdomen, acid regurgitation. Uncommon: nausea, vomiting, gastritis, oesophagitis*, oesophageal erosion*, melena. Rare: oesophagus stricture *, oropharyngeal ulceration*, perforations, ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (see section 4.4<unk>. * See sections 4.2 and 4.4.
rash, pruritus, erythema. Rare: rash with photosensitivity. Very rare: severe skin reactions including Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Common: musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain.
Rare: severe musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain (see section 4.4).
Rare: symptomatic hypocalcaemia, usually in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (see section 4.4).
Rare: transient symptoms of acute phase reaction (myalgia, discomfort and rare fever), usually at the onset of therapy.
Following reactions have been reported (frequency unknown):
jaw osteonecrosis has been reported in bisphosphonate patients; most reports have been from cancer patients, but osteoporosis patients have also been reported.
jaw osteonecrosis is usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis).
Cancer diagnosis, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also considered risk factors (see section 4.4).
In clinical trials, asymptomatic, mild, and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18% and 10% of those taking alendronate 10 mg/ day, respectively, compared to approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo.
However, decreases in serum calcium to <unk> 8.0 mg/ dl (2.0 mmol/ l) and serum phosphate to 2.0 mg/ dl (0.65 mmol/ l) occurred with a similar frequency in both treatment arms.
Oral overdose may result in hypocalcaemia, hypophosphatemia and upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as upset stomach, heartburn, oesophagitis, gastritis or ulcers.
No specific experience exists in the treatment of alendronate overdose.
In case of an overdose with ADROVANCE, milk or antacids should be given to bind alendronate.
Due to the risk of oesophageal irritation, no vomiting measures should be taken and the patient should remain upright.
Colecalciferol No vitamin D toxicity has been documented for doses of less than 10,000 IU / day In a clinical trial in healthy adults, a daily dose of 4,000 IU
vitamin D3 for up to 5 months is not associated with hypercalciuria or hypercalcaemia.
ADROVANCE is a combination tablet with the active ingredients sodium alendronate 3 H2O and colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Alendronate Sodium alendronate 3 H2O is a bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts without exerting a direct effect on bone formation.
Preclinical studies have shown that alendronate primarily concentrates at sites of active absorption.
The activity of osteoclasts is inhibited, but recruitment and bonding of osteoclasts are not affected.
The bone formed during alendronate therapy is of normal quality.
Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3.
In cases of insufficient sunlight, it is essential that vitamin D3 is a component of food.
Vitamin D3 is converted into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the liver and stored until it is needed.
Conversion to the active calcium mobilising hormone 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) in the kidney is strictly regulated.
The main effect of 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and to regulate serum calcium, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.
vitamin D3 is necessary for normal bone formation.
D deficiency occurs when insufficient exposure to the sun and food intake.
Deficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, bone loss, and an increased risk of skeletal fractures.
In severe cases, deficiency may lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphatemia, proximal muscle weakness and osteomalacia, and thus to a further increased risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic subjects.
Vitamin D supplementation reduces these risks and their consequences.
bone mineral density) in the spine or hip that is 2.5 standard deviations below the mean for a normal, young population, or regardless of bone density as a pathological fracture.
trials of ADROVANCE The effect of the lower dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronate<unk> 2,800 IU of vitamin D3) on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15-week, multinational trial in 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis (mean serum baseline of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D: 56 nmol/ <unk> 22.3 ng/ ml; range: 22.5 -225 nmol/ l <unk> 9 -90 ng/ ml <unk>).
Patients were receiving lower strength ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n/ 350) or FOSAMAX (alendronate) 70 mg once weekly (n/ 332), with no other vitamin D supplements.
After 15 weeks of treatment, mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher (26%) in the ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (56 nmol/ 23 ng/ ml) group than in the alendronate alone group (46 nmol/ l / 18.2 ng/ ml).
ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) significantly decreased the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <unk> 37.5 nmol/ <unk> 15 ng/ ml <unk>) by 62.5% compared to alendronate alone (12% vs.
32%).
ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <unk> 22.5 nmol/ l <unk> 9 ng/ ml <unk>) by 92% compared to alendronate alone (1% vs. 13%).
In this trial, after 15 weeks, mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in vitamin D deficient patients increased from 30 nmol/ l (12.1 ng/ ml) to 40 nmol/ l (15.9 ng/ ml) in the ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n/ 75) group and decreased from 30 nmol/ l (12.0 ng/ ml) at the start of the trial to 26 nmol/ l (10.4 ng/ ml) in the alendronate alone (n/ 70) group.
There were no differences between the treatment groups with regard to the mean values of serum calcium, phosphate or calcium in 24-hour urine.
The effect of the lower dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronate<unk> 2,800 IU of vitamin D3) with an additional dose of 2,800 IU of vitamin D3, totaling 5,600 IU
vitamin D3 (equivalent to the amount of vitamin D3 in the higher dose of ADROVANCE) given weekly was shown in a 24 week extension study in 619 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.
Patients in the 2,800 IU vitamin D3 group received ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n/ 299) and those in the 5,600 IU vitamin D3 group received ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) and an additional 2,800 IU vitamin D3 (n/ 309) once weekly; additional vitamin D supplements were permitted; after 24 weeks of treatment, mean serum levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher in the 5,600 IU vitamin D3 group (69 nmol/ 27.6 ng/ ml <unk>) than in the 2,800 IU vitamin D3 group (64 nmol/ 25.5 ng/ ml <unk>).
The proportion of vitamin D deficient patients during the 24 week extension trial was 5.4% in the 2,800 IU vitamin D 3 group vs.
3.2% in the 5,600 IU vitamin D 3 group. The proportion of
D deficiency was 0.3% in the 2,800 IU vitamin D 3 group vs. 0% in the 5,600 IU vitamin D 3 group.
There were no differences between the treatment groups with regard to the mean values of serum calcium, phosphate or calcium in 24-hour urine.
There was no statistically significant difference between treatment arms in the proportion of patients with hypercalciuria at the end of the 24 week extension.
trials of alendronate The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate once weekly 70 mg (n/ 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n/ 370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicentre trial in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.
Elevations above baseline lumbar BMD were 5.1% (95% CI:
4.8, 5.4%) in the 70 mg weekly and 5.4% (95% CI:
5.0, 5.8%) in the 10 mg daily group.
Mean BMD increases were 2.3% and 2.9% respectively for the femoral neck and 2.9% and 3.1% for the entire hip in the 70 mg weekly and 10 mg daily groups.
The two treatment arms were also comparable in BMD increases at other skeletal sites.
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were investigated in two identical design Phase II (n/ 944) and Fracture Intervention (FIT: n/ 6,459) studies.
In the Phase III-1 trials, mean increases in BMD with alendronate were 10 mg/ day versus placebo at 3 years, 8.8% in the spine, 5.9% in the femoral neck, and 7.8% in the trochanter.
The BMD of the total skeleton also increased significantly.
In the alendronate treated group, a 48% reduction (alendronate 3.2% vs. placebo 6.2%) was achieved in the proportion of patients who sustained one or more vertebral fractures compared to the placebo group.
Throughout the two year extension of these studies, spinal and trochanter BMD continued to rise and femoral and body BMD was maintained.
FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled studies in which alendronate was given daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and subsequently 10 mg daily for either 1 or 2 years):
FIT 1: a three-year trial of 2,027 patients with at least one pre-existing vertebral compression fracture.
In this study, daily alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% vs. placebo 15.0%).
In addition, a significant reduction in the incidence of hip fractures (1.1% vs. 2.2%; reduction of 51%) was observed.
FIT 2: a four year trial of 4,432 patients with low bone mass but without pre-existing vertebral fracture.
In this study, a significant difference in the incidence of hip fractures (alendronate 1.0% vs. placebo 2.2%; reduction of 56%) and in the incidence of at least one vertebral fracture (2.9% vs. 5.8%; reduction of 50%) was observed in analysis of the subgroup of osteoporotic women (37% of the total number suffering from osteoporosis as defined above).
Regarding intravenous reference dose, mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nocturnal fasting and two hours prior to standardized breakfast.
Bioavailability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% when alendronate was given one or half an hour prior to a standardized breakfast
20. In osteoporosis studies, alendronate was effective when taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.
The alendronate component of the ADROVANCE combination tablet (70 mg/ 5,600 IU) and a tablet of 70 mg alendronate are bioequivalent.
Bioavailability was minimal when alendronate was used with or up to two hours after a standardized breakfast.
Taking alendronate concomitantly with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60%.
In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg 3 times daily for five days) did not result in a clinically important change in oral bioavailability of alendronate (mean increase in the 20% to 44% range).
Distribution Studies in rats have shown that alendronate temporarily disseminates into soft tissue after the intravenous administration of 1 mg/ kg, but is then rapidly redistributed to the bone or excreted in the urine.
The mean steady-state volume of the distribution is at least 28 litres in humans, excluding bones.
Plasma concentrations after oral therapeutic doses of alendronate are too low for analytical detection (<unk> 5 ng/ ml).
The protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78 <unk>.
biotransformation There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolised in animals or humans.
After the intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C-alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactively labelled substance was excreted within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was detected in the faeces.
After the intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml/ min and the systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml/ min.
plasma concentrations decreased by more than 95% within six hours after intravenous administration.
The human terminal half-life is estimated at over ten years, taking into account the release of alendronate from the skeleton.
In rats, alendronate is not excreted via the acidic or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and is therefore not thought to affect the excretion of other medicines by these transport systems in humans.
In healthy adult subjects (women and men) after ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 5,600 IU) after nocturnal fasting and two hours before meal intake, the mean surface area below the serum concentration time curve (AUC0-80 h) for vitamin D3 was 490.2 ng h/ ml (excluding endogenous vitamin D3 levels).
The mean maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of vitamin D3 was 12.2 ng/ ml and the median time to reach peak serum concentration (Tmax) was 10.6 hours.
The bioavailability of 5,600 IU of vitamin D3 in ADROVANCE is comparable to that of 5,600 IU of vitamin D3 alone.
Distribution After absorption, vitamin D3 is absorbed into the blood as a component of chylomicrons.
Vitamin D3 is rapidly distributed, primarily to the liver, where it is metabolised into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the main store.
Smaller amounts are distributed in fat and muscle tissue and are stored there as vitamin D3 before being released into the circulation.
Circulating vitamin D3 is bound to vitamin D binding protein.
21 vitamin D3 is rapidly hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and then metabolised in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the biologically active form.
Further hydroxylation occurs prior to excretion.
A small amount of vitamin D3 is glucuronised prior to excretion.
When radioactively labelled vitamin D3 was administered to healthy subjects, the mean level of radioactivity in the urine was 2.4% after 48 hours, and 4.9% in the faeces after 4 days.
In both cases, radioactivity was excreted almost exclusively as metabolites of the starting substance.
The mean half-life of vitamin D3 in serum is approximately 24 hours after an oral dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU).
Characteristics in patients Preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate not deposited in the bone is rapidly excreted via urine.
No evidence was found of bone saturation after long-term doses of cumulative intravenous doses of up to 35 mg/ kg in animals.
Although no clinical data are available, renal elimination of alendronate is expected to be reduced in patients with impaired renal function, as in animal studies.
Patients with impaired renal function are therefore expected to experience slightly increased accumulation of alendronate in bone (see section 4.2).
No non-clinical trials of the combination of alendronate and colecalciferol were conducted.
Alendronate Non-clinical data based on conventional safety, chronic toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential studies show no particular human risk.
Studies in rats showed that administration of alendronate to pregnant rats was associated with the occurrence of mother dystocia due to hypocalcaemia.
In studies, high doses in rats caused an increased occurrence of incomplete ossification in the fetus.
The significance of this observation for humans is unknown.
Colecalciferol In animal studies, reproductive toxicity effects were observed at doses far greater than the therapeutic dose in humans.

This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) explaining how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations on the use of the product.
For more information about your disease or treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also included in EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
For more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of EPAR).
Advate consists of a powder and a solvent mixed to produce a solution for injection.
Advate contains the active substance octocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII).
Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by deficiency of factor VIII).
Advate is indicated for both short- and long-term use.
This medicinal product is available only on prescription.
Treatment with Advate should be initiated by a doctor with experience in the treatment of haemophilia.
Advate is administered by injection into a vein at a rate of up to 10 ml per minute.
The dosage and frequency of administration depend on whether Advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgery.
The dosage is also adjusted according to the severity of the bleeding and type of surgery.
Detailed information on the calculation of doses can be found in the Package Leaflet.
The active substance in Advate, Octocog alfa, is a protein in the blood clotting factor.
Factor VIII is one of the substances (factors) in the body involved in blood clotting.
Patients with haemophilia A suffer from factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.
Advate is used to replace the missing factor VIII.
It corrects factor VIII deficiency and enables temporary control of bleeding disorder.
Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced using a method known as recombinant DNA technology:

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. How has Advate been investigated? Advate is similar to another medicinal product authorised in the European Union called Recombinate, but manufactured in a different way so that the medicinal product does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.
For this reason, a major study of 111 patients with haemophilia A compared Advate to Recombinate to show that both medicines are equivalent. In addition, the number of bleeding episodes and the efficacy of Advate in haemostasis were evaluated on a scale of ineffective to excellent in 107 patients receiving all Advate. Three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a trial of 53 children under six years of age, investigated the use of the medicine for preventing bleeding and for surgery.
What benefit has Advate shown in these trials?
In the main study, the efficacy of Advate in preventing bleeding in 86% of 510 new bleeding episodes was excellent or well evaluated.
Moreover, in 81% of these bleeding episodes, only one treatment with Advate was necessary.
Additional studies, including the trial in children under six, confirmed the efficacy of Advate.
Patients with haemophilia A may form antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII.
An antibody is a protein produced by the body by its natural protective mechanism in response to unknown substances.
If antibodies develop, the efficacy of Advate is not assured.
The most common adverse reactions of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever), and antibody formation to factor VIII
Hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) has been observed in some patients treated with medicines containing factor VIII.
For a full list of reported adverse reactions associated with Advate, see the Package Leaflet.
Advate should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the ingredients.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Advate in the treatment and propyhlaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital deficiency of factor VIII) outweigh the risks and recommended authorisation for the marketing of Advate.
On 2 March 2004, the European Commission authorised Baxter AG to market Advate throughout the European Union.
The authorisation was renewed on 2 March 2009.
The full EPAR for Advate is available here.
powder: vial (glass) solvent: vial (glass)
1 vial + 1 vial + reconstitution device
ADVATE 250 IU powder and solvent for preparation of solution for injection
Each bottle contains a nominal 250 IU/ recombinant clotting factor VIII (rDNA) Octocog alfa/ *.
After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains approximately 50 IU/ ml of Octocog alfa.
Activity (international units) is determined by the chromogenic assay against an in-house standard referred to as the WHO. Specific activity is approximately 4,000-10,000 IU/ mg protein <unk> / human clotting factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovarian cells (CHO).
Prepared without the addition of an (exogenous) human or animal protein during cell culture, purification and final formulation.
0.45 mmol sodium chloride (10 mg) per vial.
For a full list of excipients see section 6.1.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free of foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3.
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be carried out under the supervision of a doctor familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of Factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.
on demand The Factor VIII dose is given in international units (IU) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII-products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is given either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the international standard for factor VIII in plasma).
2 IU of factor VIII-activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in a ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the necessary Factor VIII dose is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU
Factor VIII per kg bodyweight increases factor VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII increase (%) x 0.5
In subsequent haemorrhagic events, factor VIII-activity should not decrease below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in IU/ dl) over the corresponding period.
The following Table 1 indicates dosage in haemorrhage and surgery:
Table 1: Dosage guidance for bleeding events and operations Grade of bleeding / type of surgery Bleeding
Required factor VIII (% or IU/ dl)
dosage frequency (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
early joint bleeding, muscle bleeding, or mouth bleeding.
injection every 12 -24 hours (8 -24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until indicated bleeding is stopped by pain or healing is achieved.
More pronounced joint bleeding, muscle bleeding, or haematoma.
injection every 12 -24 hours (8 -24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for 3 -4 days or longer until pain and acute impairment are resolved.
injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until the risk to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12 -24 hours in patients under 6 years) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity of 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted in line with the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
In certain circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate plasma level measurement is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections.
Especially in major surgery, close monitoring of substitution therapy by determination of factor VIII activity in plasma is essential.
Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-lives.
3 prophylaxis Long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in severe haemophilia A patients should be given doses between 20 and 40 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 2 to 3 days apart.
In patients under 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 3 4 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored regularly for formation of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test should be performed to detect an inhibitor.
In patients with high inhibitors, Factor VIII may not be effective and other therapeutic measures may need to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in treating patients with haemophilia. See section 4.4.
method of administration ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate prior training is necessary.
The rate of administration should vary with the condition of the patient and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml/ min should not be exceeded.
For the benefit of patients, it is recommended that each administration of ADVATE should include the name and batch number of the product.
Reconstitution information prior to administration see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to active ingredients or any of the ingredients, or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, allergic hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
This product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be aware of immediate signs of hypersensitivity, such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory discomfort (e. g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should discontinue treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
In the event of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be carried out in accordance with current medical standards (see section 4.8).
The formation of factor VIII neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A
These inhibitors are procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by a modified Bethesda assay.
Patients who develop factor VIII inhibitors may experience an inadequate clinical response.
In such cases, contact with a haemophilia centre is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the level of exposure to factor VIII, with the highest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and depending on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (lowtitre) inhibitors was observed after conversion from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
After reconstitution, this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
This should be considered in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5. Interactions with other medicines and other interactions
No studies have been carried out into the interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products.
No animal reproduction studies were conducted with factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, no experience exists of the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
Factor VIII should therefore only be used during pregnancy and lactation if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no impact on ability to drive or use machines.
As with any intravenous protein, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible (see section 4.4).
A total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 of 234 once-treated patients during clinical trials of ADVATE.
The ADRs seen in the largest number of patients were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients at higher risk for inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
No adverse reactions were observed in newborns, 16 were reported in 13<unk> 32 infants, 7 in 4<unk> 56 children, 8 in 4<unk> 31 adolescents and 25 in 14<unk> 94 adults.
Frequency categories are defined by the following criteria: Very common (1<unk> 10), common (1<unk> 100 to 1<unk> 10), occasional (1<unk> 1,000 to 1<unk> 100), rare (1<unk> 10,000 to 1<unk> 1,000), very rare (1<unk> 10,000), unknown (frequency cannot be estimated based on available data).
Adverse reactions after decreasing severity are listed within the frequencies.

a) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in blood clotting factor VIII occurred postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperatively) in a continuous ADVATE infusion patient.
Clotting was maintained throughout and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to adequate levels on day 15 postoperatively.
At the end of the continuous infusion, tests for factor VIII inhibitors were conducted and negative at the end of the study.
inhibitor development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient exhibited a low inhibitortiter (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
In addition, no FVIII inhibitor was detected in any of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) ADVATE treated patients were inhibitors of factor VIII
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titer (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The detection frequency of FVIII inhibitors to date is in line with expectations and in the range already observed.
Patients "immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters, and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 showed a statistically significant uptrend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients exhibited sustained peaks or transient peaks.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms suggesting an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity were observed.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 exhibited a statistically significant uptick in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients exhibited sustained peak or transitory peak.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels against murine IgG.
In four patients, isolated occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes following multiple repeated product exposures were reported in the study.
As with other intravenous products, ADVATE has been reported to exhibit allergic type hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reaction (frequency unknown).
human overdose symptoms of recombinant blood clotting factor VIII are unknown.
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and von Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant clotting factor VIII (Octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to the glycoprotein present in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 280 kD.
When octocog alfa is given to a haemophilia A patient, it binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor in the bloodstream.
The activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
The activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clot formation can occur.
Haemophilia A is a gender-based, hereditary blood clotting disorder due to decreased Factor VIII levels.
This results in severe bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
The factor VIII-plasma levels are increased by substitution therapy, whereby a transient correction of factor VIII-deficiency and bleeding tendency occurs.
All pharmacokinetics studies of ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
The plasma samples were evaluated in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting test.
The pharmacokinetic parameters are from a cross-over trial of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or equal to 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below.

The recovery and measured half-life in infants (below 6 years) was approximately 20% lower than in adults, which may be due to the higher plasma volume per kg bodyweight in younger patients.
There are no pharmacokinetic data on the use of ADVATE in previously untreated patients.
Nonclinical data, based on safety pharmacology, acute, repeated and local toxicity and genotoxicity studies, show no specific human risk.

ADVATE 1000 IU powder and solvent for the preparation of a solution for injection
Each bottle contains a nominal 1000 IU/ recombinant clotting factor VIII (rDNA) Octocog alfa/ *.
After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains approximately 200 IU/ ml of Octocog alfa.
Activity (international units) is determined by the chromogenic assay against an in-house standard referred to as the WHO. Specific activity is approximately 4,000-10,000 IU/ mg protein <unk> / human clotting factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovarian cells (CHO).
Prepared without the addition of an (exogenous) human or animal protein during cell culture, purification and final formulation.
0.45 mmol sodium chloride (10 mg) per vial.
For a full list of excipients see section 6.1.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free of foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3.
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be carried out under the supervision of a doctor familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of Factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.
on demand The Factor VIII dose is given in international units (IU) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII-products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is given either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the international standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One IU of factor VIII activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required Factor VIII dose is based on empirical evidence that 1 IU of Factor VIII per kg bodyweight increases Factor VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII increase (%) x 0.5
In subsequent haemorrhagic events, factor VIII-activity should not decrease below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in IU/ dl) over the corresponding period.
The following Table 1 indicates dosage in haemorrhage and surgery:
Table 1: Dosage guidance for bleeding events and operations Grade of bleeding / type of surgery Bleeding
Required factor VIII (% or IU/ dl)
dosage frequency (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
early joint bleeding, muscle bleeding, or mouth bleeding.
injection every 12 -24 hours (8 -24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until indicated bleeding is stopped by pain or healing is achieved.
More pronounced joint bleeding, muscle bleeding, or haematoma.
injection every 12 -24 hours (8 -24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for 3 -4 days or longer until pain and acute impairment are resolved.
injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until the risk to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12 -24 hours in patients under 6 years) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity of 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted in line with the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
In certain circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate plasma level measurement is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections.
Especially in major surgery, close monitoring of substitution therapy by determination of factor VIII activity in plasma is essential.
Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-lives.
Long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in severe haemophilia A patients should be given doses between 20 and 40 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 2 to 3 days apart.
In patients under 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 3 4 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored regularly for formation of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test should be performed to detect an inhibitor.
In patients with high inhibitors, Factor VIII may not be effective and other therapeutic measures may need to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in treating patients with haemophilia. See section 4.4.
method of administration ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate prior training is necessary.
The rate of administration should vary with the condition of the patient and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml/ min should not be exceeded.
For the benefit of patients, it is recommended that each administration of ADVATE should include the name and batch number of the product.
Reconstitution information prior to administration see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to active ingredients or any of the ingredients, or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, allergic hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
This product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be aware of immediate signs of hypersensitivity, such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory discomfort (e. g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should discontinue treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
In the event of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be carried out in accordance with current medical standards (see section 4.8).
The formation of factor VIII neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A
These inhibitors are procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by a modified Bethesda assay.
Patients who develop factor VIII inhibitors may experience an inadequate clinical response.
In such cases, contact with a haemophilia centre is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the level of exposure to factor VIII, with the highest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and depending on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (lowtitre) inhibitors was observed after conversion from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
Following reconstitution, this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
This should be considered in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5. Interactions with other medicines and other interactions
No studies have been carried out into the interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products.
No animal reproduction studies were conducted with factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, no experience exists of the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
Factor VIII should therefore only be used during pregnancy and lactation if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no impact on ability to drive or use machines.
As with any intravenous protein, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible (see section 4.4).
A total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 of 234 once-treated patients during clinical trials of ADVATE.
The ADRs seen in the largest number of patients were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients at higher risk for inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
No adverse reactions were reported in newborns, 16 in 13<unk> 32 infants, 7 in 4<unk> 56 children, 8 in 4<unk> 31 adolescents and 25 in 14<unk> 94 adults.
Frequency categories are defined by the following criteria: Very common (1<unk> 10), common (1<unk> 100 to 1<unk> 10), occasional (1<unk> 1,000 to 1<unk> 100), rare (1<unk> 10,000 to 1<unk> 1,000), very rare (1<unk> 10,000), unknown (frequency cannot be estimated based on available data).
Adverse reactions after decreasing severity are listed within the frequencies.

a) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in blood clotting factor VIII occurred postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperatively) in a continuous ADVATE infusion patient.
Clotting was maintained throughout and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to adequate levels on day 15 postoperatively.
At the end of the continuous infusion, tests for factor VIII inhibitors were conducted and negative at the end of the study.
inhibitor development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient exhibited a low inhibitortiter (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
In addition, no FVIII inhibitor was detected in any of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) ADVATE treated patients were inhibitors of factor VIII
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titer (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The detection frequency of FVIII inhibitors to date is in line with expectations and in the range already observed.
Patients "immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters, and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 showed a statistically significant uptrend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients exhibited sustained peaks or transient peaks.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms suggesting an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity were observed.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 exhibited a statistically significant uptick in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients exhibited sustained peak or transitory peak.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels against murine IgG.
In four patients, isolated occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes following multiple repeated product exposures were reported in the study.
As with other intravenous products, ADVATE has been reported to exhibit allergic type hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reaction (frequency unknown).
human overdose symptoms of recombinant blood clotting factor VIII are unknown.
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and von Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions.
ADVATE contains recombinant clotting factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 280 kD.
When octocog alfa is given to a haemophilia A patient, it binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor in the bloodstream.
The activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
The activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clot formation can occur.
Haemophilia A is a gender-based, hereditary blood clotting disorder due to decreased Factor VIII levels.
This results in severe bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
The factor VIII-plasma levels are increased by substitution therapy, whereby a transient correction of factor VIII-deficiency and bleeding tendency occurs.
All pharmacokinetics studies of ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
The plasma samples were evaluated in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting test.
The pharmacokinetic parameters are from a cross-over trial of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or equal to 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below.

In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient exhibited a low inhibitortiter (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
In addition, no FVIII inhibitor was detected in any of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) ADVATE treated patients were inhibitors of factor VIII
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titer (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The detection frequency of FVIII inhibitors to date is in line with expectations and in the range already observed.
Patients "immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters, and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 showed a statistically significant uptrend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients exhibited sustained peaks or transient peaks.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms suggesting an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity were observed.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 exhibited a statistically significant uptick in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients exhibited sustained peak or transitory peak.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels against murine IgG.
In four patients, isolated occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes following multiple repeated product exposures were reported in the study.
As with other intravenous products, ADVATE has been reported to exhibit allergic type hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reaction (frequency unknown).
human overdose symptoms of recombinant blood clotting factor VIII are unknown.
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and von Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions.
ADVATE contains recombinant clotting factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 280 kD.
When octocog alfa is given to a haemophilia A patient, it binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor in the bloodstream.
The activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
The activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clot formation can occur.
Haemophilia A is a gender-based, hereditary blood clotting disorder due to decreased Factor VIII levels.
This results in severe bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
The factor VIII-plasma levels are increased by substitution therapy, whereby a transient correction of factor VIII-deficiency and bleeding tendency occurs.
All pharmacokinetics studies of ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
The plasma samples were evaluated in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting test.
The pharmacokinetic parameters are from a cross-over trial of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or equal to 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below.

The recovery and measured half-life in infants (below 6 years) was approximately 20% lower than in adults, which may be due to the higher plasma volume per kg bodyweight in younger patients.
There are no pharmacokinetic data on the use of ADVATE in previously untreated patients.
Nonclinical data, based on safety pharmacology, acute, repeated and local toxicity and genotoxicity studies, show no specific human risk.

ADVATE 2000 IU powder and solvent for the preparation of a solution for injection
Each bottle contains a nominal 2000 IU/ recombinant clotting factor VIII (rDNA) Octocog alfa/ *.
After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains approximately 400 IU/ ml of Octocog alfa.
Activity (international units) is determined by the chromogenic assay against an in-house standard referred to as the WHO. Specific activity is approximately 4,000-10,000 IU/ mg protein <unk> / human clotting factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovarian cells (CHO).
Prepared without the addition of an (exogenous) human or animal protein during cell culture, purification and final formulation.
0.45 mmol sodium chloride (10 mg) per vial.
For a full list of excipients see section 6.1.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free of foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3.
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be carried out under the supervision of a doctor familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of Factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.
on demand The Factor VIII dose is given in international units (IU) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII-products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is given either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the international standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One IU of factor VIII activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required Factor VIII dose is based on empirical evidence that 1 IU of Factor VIII per kg bodyweight increases Factor VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII increase (%) x 0.5
In subsequent haemorrhagic events, factor VIII-activity should not decrease below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in IU/ dl) over the corresponding period.
The following Table 1 indicates dosage in haemorrhage and surgery:
Table 1: Dosage guidance for bleeding events and operations Grade of bleeding / type of surgery Bleeding
Required factor VIII (% or IU/ dl)
dosage frequency (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
early joint bleeding, muscle bleeding, or mouth bleeding.
injection every 12 -24 hours (8 -24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until indicated bleeding is stopped by pain or healing is achieved.
More pronounced joint bleeding, muscle bleeding, or haematoma.
injection every 12 -24 hours (8 -24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for 3 -4 days or longer until pain and acute impairment are resolved.
injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until the risk to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12 -24 hours in patients under 6 years) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity of 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted in line with the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
In certain circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate plasma level measurement is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections.
Especially in major surgery, close monitoring of substitution therapy by determination of factor VIII activity in plasma is essential.
Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-lives.
47 prophylaxis Long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in severe haemophilia A patients should be given doses between 20 and 40 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 2 to 3 days apart.
In patients under 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 3 4 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored regularly for formation of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test should be performed to detect an inhibitor.
In patients with high inhibitors, Factor VIII may not be effective and other therapeutic measures may need to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in treating patients with haemophilia. See section 4.4.
method of administration ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate prior training is necessary.
The rate of administration should vary with the condition of the patient and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml/ min should not be exceeded.
For the benefit of patients, it is recommended that each administration of ADVATE should include the name and batch number of the product.
Reconstitution information prior to administration see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to active ingredients or any of the ingredients, or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, allergic hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
This product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be aware of immediate signs of hypersensitivity, such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory discomfort (e. g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should discontinue treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
In the event of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be carried out in accordance with current medical standards (see section 4.8).
The formation of factor VIII neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A
These inhibitors are procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by a modified Bethesda assay.
Patients who develop factor VIII inhibitors may experience an inadequate clinical response.
In such cases, contact with a haemophilia centre is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the level of exposure to factor VIII, with the highest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and depending on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (lowtitre) inhibitors was observed after conversion from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
48 This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial after reconstitution.
This should be considered in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5. Interactions with other medicines and other interactions
No studies have been carried out into the interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products.
No animal reproduction studies were conducted with factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, no experience exists of the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
Factor VIII should therefore only be used during pregnancy and lactation if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no impact on ability to drive or use machines.
As with any intravenous protein, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible (see section 4.4).
A total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 of 234 once-treated patients during clinical trials of ADVATE.
The ADRs seen in the largest number of patients were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients at higher risk for inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
No adverse reactions were reported in newborns, 16 in 13<unk> 32 infants, 7 in 4<unk> 56 children, 8 in 4<unk> 31 adolescents and 25 in 14<unk> 94 adults.
Frequency categories are defined by the following criteria: Very common (1<unk> 10), common (1<unk> 100 to 1<unk> 10), occasional (1<unk> 1,000 to 1<unk> 100), rare (1<unk> 10,000 to 1<unk> 1,000), very rare (1<unk> 10,000), unknown (frequency cannot be estimated based on available data).
Adverse reactions after decreasing severity are listed within the frequencies.
Table 2 shows the frequency of adverse events in clinical trials:

a) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in blood clotting factor VIII occurred postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperatively) in a continuous ADVATE infusion patient.
Clotting was maintained throughout and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to adequate levels on day 15 postoperatively.
At the end of the continuous infusion, tests for factor VIII inhibitors were conducted and negative at the end of the study.
inhibitor development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient exhibited a low inhibitortiter (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.

All patients treated with clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
After reconstitution, this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
This should be considered in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5. Interactions with other medicines and other interactions
No studies have been carried out into the interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products.
No animal reproduction studies were conducted with factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, no experience exists of the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
Factor VIII should therefore only be used during pregnancy and lactation if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no impact on ability to drive or use machines.
As with any intravenous protein, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible (see section 4.4).
A total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 of 234 once-treated patients during clinical trials of ADVATE.
The ADRs seen in the largest number of patients were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients at higher risk for inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
No adverse reactions were reported in newborns, 16 in 13<unk> 32 infants, 7 in 4<unk> 56 children, 8 in 4<unk> 31 adolescents and 25 in 14<unk> 94 adults.
Frequency categories are defined by the following criteria: Very common (1<unk> 10), common (1<unk> 100 to 1<unk> 10), occasional (1<unk> 1,000 to 1<unk> 100), rare (1<unk> 10,000 to 1<unk> 1,000), very rare (1<unk> 10,000), unknown (frequency cannot be estimated based on available data).
Adverse reactions after decreasing severity are listed within the frequencies.
Table 2 shows the frequency of adverse events in clinical trials:

a) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in blood clotting factor VIII occurred postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperatively) in a continuous ADVATE infusion patient.
Clotting was maintained throughout and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to adequate levels on day 15 postoperatively.
At the end of the continuous infusion, tests for factor VIII inhibitors were conducted and negative at the end of the study.
inhibitor development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient exhibited a low inhibitortiter (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
In addition, no FVIII inhibitor was detected in any of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) ADVATE treated patients were inhibitors of factor VIII
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titer (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The detection frequency of FVIII inhibitors to date is in line with expectations and in the range already observed.
Patients "immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters, and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 showed a statistically significant uptrend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients exhibited sustained peaks or transient peaks.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms suggesting an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity were observed.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 exhibited a statistically significant uptick in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients exhibited sustained peak or transitory peak.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels against murine IgG.
In four patients, isolated occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes following multiple repeated product exposures were reported in the study.
As with other intravenous products, ADVATE has been reported to exhibit allergic type hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reaction (frequency unknown).
human overdose symptoms of recombinant blood clotting factor VIII are unknown.
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and von Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions.
ADVATE contains recombinant clotting factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 280 kD.
When octocog alfa is given to a haemophilia A patient, it binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor in the bloodstream.
The activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
The activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clot formation can occur.
Haemophilia A is a gender-based, hereditary blood clotting disorder due to decreased Factor VIII levels.
This results in severe bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
The factor VIII-plasma levels are increased by substitution therapy, whereby a transient correction of factor VIII-deficiency and bleeding tendency occurs.
All pharmacokinetics studies of ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
The plasma samples were evaluated in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting test.
The pharmacokinetic parameters are from a cross-over trial of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or equal to 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below.

The recovery and measured half-life in infants (below 6 years) was approximately 20% lower than in adults, which may be due to the higher plasma volume per kg bodyweight in younger patients.
There are no pharmacokinetic data on the use of ADVATE in previously untreated patients.
Nonclinical data, based on safety pharmacology, acute, repeated and local toxicity and genotoxicity studies, show no specific human risk.

Read all of the Package Leaflet carefully before starting to use this medicine.
- If you have any further questions, contact your doctor.
- This medicine has been prescribed to you.
Do not disclose it to third parties.
It can harm other people, even if they have the same discomfort as you.
- If any of the listed side effects significantly affect you or you
If you notice any undesirable effects not listed in this leaflet, tell your doctor.
What is ADVATE and what it is used for?
2. What should be considered before using ADVATE? 3. How should ADVATE be used?
WHAT ADVATE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
As a active substance, ADVATE contains human coagulation factor VIII, Octocog alfa, produced by recombinant DNA technology.
Factor VIII is necessary for clots to form in the blood to stop bleeding.
In patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency), it is absent or not functioning correctly.
ADVATE is used in patients with haemophilia A to prevent or treat spontaneous haemorrhage or bleeding following surgery.
ADVATE is produced without the addition of a human or animal protein during cell culture, purification and final formulation.
WHAT YOU MUST REGARD TO ADVATE BEFORE USE
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to Octocog alfa or any of the ingredients
- if you are allergic to mouse or hamster protein.
If in doubt, ask your doctor.
Special care should be taken when using ADVATE You should tell your doctor if you have recently been treated with Factor VIII products, especially if you have developed inhibitors.
This increases the risk of recurrence. Inhibitors are neutralising antibodies to factor VIII that reduce ADVATE's efficacy in preventing or controlling bleeding.
The development of inhibitors is a known complication of haemophilia A treatment.
If your bleeding cannot be controlled with ADVATE, contact your doctor immediately
There is a small possibility that you will develop an anaphylactic reaction (a sudden, severe, allergic reaction) to ADVATE.
You should be aware of early signs of such
These symptoms may include early signs of anaphylactic shock, which may include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness, and extreme difficulty breathing.
If any of these symptoms occur, discontinue the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe symptoms such as
difficulty breathing and (near fainting) need immediate emergency treatment.
When taking other medicines Please tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken them, even if they are non-prescription medicines.
Be sure to tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.
Your doctor will decide whether you can use ADVATE during pregnancy and lactation.
ability to drive and use machines ADVATE has no effect on ability to drive and use machines.
Important information about certain other ingredients of ADVATE This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
This should be considered in patients on a sodium restricted diet.
ADVATE treatment is initiated by a doctor with experience in the treatment of haemophilia A.
Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or IU) depending on your physical condition and body weight, and whether it is used to prevent or treat bleeding.
The frequency depends on how well ADVATE works in you.
Replacement therapy with ADVATE is usually lifelong.
prevention of bleeding The usual dose of Octocog alfa is 20 -40 IU per kg body weight, given every 2 -3 days.
However, in some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may be necessary.
Treatment of bleeding The dose of Octocog alfa is determined by body weight and target factor VIII-levels.
The factor VIII level required varies with the severity and site of bleeding.
dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII-increase (% of normal) x 0.5
If you feel that the effect of ADVATE is inadequate, tell your doctor.
Your doctor will periodically conduct appropriate laboratory tests to ensure you have adequate factor VIII levels.
This is especially important for major surgery.
Patients who develop factor VIII inhibitors If the expected levels of factor VIII in your plasma are not achieved with ADVATE, or if bleeding cannot be controlled, factor VIII may
99 inhibitors, this will be determined by your doctor.
You may need higher ADVATE doses or even another product to control bleeding.
Do not increase the dosage of ADVATE to control your bleeding without asking your doctor.
How ADVATE is administered ADVATE is usually given by the doctor into a vein (intravenously).
If you or someone else is administering ADVATE, this should only be done after appropriate training.
Detailed information on self-treatment can be found at the end of the leaflet.
If you have used a greater amount of ADVATE than you should, use ADVATE exactly as your doctor has recommended.
Ask your doctor if you are unsure.
If you have used a larger amount, please contact your doctor as soon as possible.
If you have forgotten to use ADVATE Do not inject twice the dose if you have missed the previous dose.
Carry on with the next scheduled administration immediately as advised by your doctor.
If you wish to discontinue use of ADVATE, do not discontinue use of ADVATE without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions about the use of this product, contact your doctor.
Like all medicines, ADVATE may have side effects, but these may not be evident in everyone.
If sudden, severe (anaphylactic) side effects occur, the injection must be discontinued immediately. Contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early symptoms of allergic (hypersensitive) reactions:
- redness, rash, wheezing, itching all over the body,
- difficulty breathing, whistling, tightness in the chest,
Severe side effects including shortness of breath, and (near fainting require immediate emergency treatment.
Very common: more than 1 in 10 patients Common: affects between 1 and 10 in 100 Patients Uncommon: affects between 1 and 10 in 1,000 Patients Rare: affects between 1 and 10 in 10,000 Patients Very rare: affects less than 1 in 10,000 Patients Unknown: (frequency cannot be estimated based on available data).
Common side effects include dizziness, headache and fever
Uncommon side effects itching, increased sweating, unusual taste sensation, hot flashes, migraine, memory problems, chills, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, rough throat, inflammation of the lymphatic vessels, paleness, eye inflammation, rashes, extreme sweating,
100 swelling of feet and legs, increased liver enzymes, haematocrisy, and pain in the upper abdomen or lower chest
In conjunction with surgery, catheter infections, decreased red blood cell count, swelling of limbs and joints, prolonged bleeding after drainage removal, decreased factor VIII levels and post-operative haematoma.
Rare side effects Severe and potentially life-threatening reactions (anaphylaxis) and other allergic reactions (see above) have been isolated since the product was marketed.
Tell your doctor if any of the listed side effects significantly affect you or if you notice any side effects not listed in this Package Leaflet.

Q & A on the withdrawal of the marketing authorisation application for Advexin
International name (INN): Contusugene Ladenovec
On 17 December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it was withdrawing its marketing authorisation application for Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.
Advexin was designated an orphan medicine on 23 October 2006.
Advexin is a suspension injection containing Contusugene Ladovec, a genetically modified virus carrying the p53 gene.
What should Advexin be used for?
Advexin should have been used to treat Li-Fraumeni cancer in patients aged 18 years and over.
Li-Fraumeni is a type of cancer that occurs in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome who have a mutation in a gene called p53 that makes them more likely to develop cancer.
Li-Fraumeni cancer can occur in many parts of the body.
However, this usually affects the breast, brain, bones or soft tissues (tissue that surrounds and supports other structures in the body).
The active substance in Advexin, Contusugene Ladenovec, is a viral vector.
This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.
The virus in Advexin is an adenovirus that has been modified to make no copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infection in humans.
The gene that carries the virus in Advexin is the normal (not defective) p53 gene.
Advexin should have been injected directly into tumours, enabling cancer cells to reproduce the normal p53 protein.
The p53 protein, which consists of the non-defective p53 gene present in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to the killing of cells when DNA cannot be recovered.
Since cancer cells contain damaged DNA, the p53 protein helps to restore DNA or causes cells to die.
In Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not function properly and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.
Advexin should have cured the disease or slowed its progression by restoring the normal protective function of the cells.
What documents has the company submitted to CHMP in support of its application?
The effects of Advexin were first evaluated in experimental models before being evaluated in humans.
The company presented data from a trial in a patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the lower abdomen, bones and brain.
The patient received 12 Advexin injections over five months, which were injected into some of the tumours.

efficacy of the product has been evaluated by scans looking at how tumours responded to treatment, and results from several small trials evaluating the effects of a dose range of Advexin in various cancers, what stage of assessment was the withdrawal request at?
When the company withdrew its application, day 179 was reached in the application procedure.
After the CHMP reviewed the company's replies to the questions put to it, a number of questions remained unresolved.
The CHMP usually takes up to 210 days to evaluate a new application.
Based on examination of initial submissions, the CHMP will draw up a list of questions to be sent to the company on day 120.
Once the company has provided answers to these questions, they will be considered by the CHMP.
Before issuing an opinion, the CHMP may ask the company any remaining questions on day 180.
What was the CHMP recommendation at that time?
s audited data and responses to the CHMP list of questions, there were some concerns on the part of CHMP at the time of the withdrawal and the Committee's preliminary view was that Advexin could not have been approved for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni.
What were the CHMP's main concerns?
The CHMP considers that there is insufficient evidence that injection of Advexin into Li-Fraumeni delivers benefits for patients.
The Committee also had concerns about how the product is processed in the body, how it is administered and the safety of the product.
Moreover, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor to people who come into close contact with the patient.
What are the reasons why the company withdrew the application?
The letter informing EMEA of the withdrawal of the application can be found here.
What consequences does the withdrawal have for patients currently participating in clinical trials and / or Compassion Use Programmes with Advexin?
The company did not notify the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or Compassion Use Programmes with Advexin.

Aerinaze is a medicine containing the active ingredients desloratadine (2.5 mg) and pseudoephedrine (120 mg).
It is available as blue and white altered agent release tablets. Altered agent release means that the tablets are designed to release one of the active ingredients immediately and the other slowly over a few hours.
Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hayfever, nasal inflammation caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal swelling (nasal congestion).
This medicinal product is available only on prescription.
In adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over, the recommended dose of Aerinaze 2 times daily is a tablet to be taken whole with a glass of water with or without food.
The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and should be stopped as soon as the symptoms, especially swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), have subsided.
Duration of treatment of more than 10 days is not recommended, as the effects of the drug on nose constipation may decrease.
Once the nose is clear, patients can take desloratadine alone.
Aerinaze contains two active ingredients:
desloratadine, an antihistamine, and pseudoephedrine, a decongestant.
Desloratadine blocks receptors to which histamine, an endogenous substance that causes allergic symptoms, normally attaches.
When the receptors are blocked, histamine is unable to act and this relieves allergy symptoms.
Pseudoephedrine stimulates nerve endings to release the chemical messenger substance noradrenaline, which causes constriction (narrowing) of blood vessels.
This results in less fluid escaping from the vessels, so that the swelling decreases and the nose secretes less mucus.
Aerinaze combines two active ingredients because antihistamines alone often do not provide adequate relief in patients with nasal constipation.

Desloratadine is released from its layer immediately after administration, while pseudoephedrine is released slowly over 12 hours. Therefore, the tablet should only be taken 2 times daily.
The efficacy of Aerinaze has been evaluated in two main studies involving a total of 1,248 adult and adolescent patients.
In both studies, Aerinaze was compared to desloratadine alone and to pseudoephedrine alone.
The main efficacy measures were changes in the severity of hayfever symptoms reported by patients prior to commencement of treatment and during 15 days of treatment.
During the trial, patients entered their symptoms in a diary every 12 hours and used a standard scale to assess how severe their symptoms had been over the previous 12 hours.
What benefit has Aerinaze shown in these studies?
Aerinaze relieved symptoms more effectively than both agents alone.
When all hayfever symptoms except nose constipation were considered, those taking Aerinaze reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms compared to 35.9% for those taking pseudoephedrine alone.
When only nasal swelling was considered, Aerinaze patients exhibited symptoms relief of 37.4% compared to 26.7% for those taking desloratadine alone.
Similar results were observed in the second study.
The most common adverse reactions of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart failure), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), pharyngitis (pharyngitis), anorexia (anorexia), constipation, headache, tiredness, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (somnolence), trouble sleeping and nervousness.
For a full list of reported Aerinaze side effects, see the Package Leaflet.
Aerinaze should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, adrenergic agents or loratadine (another medicinal product used to treat allergies).
Do not use in patients taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (such as some antidepressant medicines) or who have stopped taking such medicines within the last two weeks.
Aerinaze should also not be used in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), urinary retention (difficult urination), cardiovascular disorders including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidism), or who have had a haemorrhagic stroke (stroke caused by cerebral haemorrhage) or are at risk of a haemorrhagic stroke.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Aerinaze in the symptomatic treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis with nasal swelling outweigh the risks and recommended authorisation for the marketing of Aerinaze.
On 30 July 2007, the European Commission authorised SP Europe to market Aerinaze throughout the European Union.

Blister (PCTFE/ PVC/ alu) 20 tablets 2.5 mg desloratadine / 120 mg pseudoephedrine sulphate 1/ 1
Each tablet contains 2.5 mg desloratadine and 120 mg pseudoephedrine (as sulphate).
For a full list of other ingredients, see section 6.1.
Oval tablet with a blue and a white layer, the blue layer is marked D12.
Symptomatic treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis with accompanying nasal swelling.
Adults and adolescents aged 12 and over:
The recommended dose of Aerinaze is one tablet 2 times daily.
The tablet may be taken with a glass of water but should be swallowed whole (i. e. without biting, breaking or chewing).
You can take it independently of meals.
Due to the lack of safety and efficacy data (see section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.
Use should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after symptoms subside.
It is recommended to limit the duration of administration to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease over time.
After decreased mucosal swelling in the upper respiratory tract, treatment with desloratadine as monotherapy may be continued as necessary.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, any of the other ingredients, adrenergic agents or loratadine.
Because Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, it is also contraindicated in patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO/ inhibitors) and within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such therapy.
Aerinaze is also contraindicated in patients with
2
- Urinary retention, - Cardiovascular disorders such as ischaemic heart disease, tachyarrhythmia and severe hypertension, - hyperthyroidism, - a history of haemorrhagic stroke or risk factors that may increase the risk of haemorrhagic stroke due to alphamimetic activity associated with combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolide, lisuride, cabergolin, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or other decongestants used perorally or nasally as a decongestant (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin, etc.).
Do not exceed the recommended dosage and duration of treatment (see section 4.2).
Patients over 60 years of age are more likely to experience adverse events with sympathomimetics such as pseudoephedrine.
The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been evaluated in this population and data are insufficient to recommend appropriate dosing regimens.
Caution should therefore be exercised when using the combination in patients over 60 years of age.
The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze have not been evaluated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and data are insufficient to recommend appropriate dosing regimens.
The combination is not recommended for use in patients with impaired renal or hepatic impairment.
Do not use Aerinaze in children under 12 years of age (see section 4.2).
Patients should be advised that treatment should be discontinued if hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, irregular heart rhythm, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or headache aggravation) occur.
Sympathomimetic amines may cause central nervous system stimulation with seizure or cardiovascular collapse with hypotension.
These effects are more likely in paediatric, elderly patients, or in case of overdose (see section 4.9).
Caution should be exercised when treating the following populations: Digitalis patients with irregular heart rhythm Patients with hypertension Patients with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, bladder obstruction or a history of bronchospasm.
Caution should be exercised when using in patients with stenosis and pyloroduodenal obstruction.
Caution should also be exercised in patients receiving other sympathomimetics.
These include: decongestants anorectics or type 3 amphetamine psychostimulants, tricyclic antidepressants and other antihistamines.
Caution should also be exercised in migraine patients receiving concomitant vasoconstricting ergotalkaloids.
Continued use may result in tolerance resulting in an increased risk of overdose.
Use of volatile halogenated anaesthetics during therapy with indirect sympathomimetics may result in perioperative acute hypertension.
Therefore, in the event of surgery, it is preferable to discontinue treatment 24 hours prior to the start of anaesthesia.
Athletes should be advised that pseudoephedrine therapy may result in positive doping tests.
Aerinaze should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological tests as antihistamines may otherwise prevent or reduce the extent of positive reactions to indicators of skin reaction.
4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other interactions
However, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in plasma concentrations of desloratadine were observed in clinical trials with additional erythromycin or ketoconazole.
Reversible and irreversible MAOI may increase the risk of vasoconstriction and hypertension.
Co-administration of sympathomimetics may result in critical hypertonic reactions.
The following concomitant therapies are not recommended: bromocriptine cabergoline lisuride, pergolide: risk of vasoconstriction and hypertension.
Dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergometrin: risk of vasoconstriction and hypertension.
Other vasoconstricting agents used orally or nasally as decongestant rhinologics (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin, etc.):
Sympathomimetics may reduce the antihypertensive effects of -methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine, veratrum alkaloids, and guanethidine.
The absorption rate of pseudoephedrine sulphate is increased by antacids and decreased by kaolin.
The interaction between Aerinaze and alcohol was not investigated.
In a clinical pharmacological trial, the concomitant administration of desloratadine and alcohol
no significant differences could be detected between those receiving desloratadine and those receiving placebo, regardless of whether desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.
The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not yet been identified, so interaction with other medicines cannot be excluded.
Desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.
In animal experiments, neither desloratadine nor the combination of loratadine and pseudoephedrine was teratogenous.
The safety of the use of Aerinaze during pregnancy has not been established, but experience from a large number of affected pregnancies has not shown an increase in the frequency of malformations compared to the incidence in the normal population.
Aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy as reproduction studies in animals cannot always be extended to humans and due to the vasoconstrictory characteristics of pseudoephedrine.
Desloratadine and pseudoephedrine are added to breast milk.
Decreased milk production has been reported in nursing mothers associated with pseudoephedrine.
Aerinaze should therefore not be used while breast-feeding.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies have been carried out on the impact of Aerinaze on ability to drive and use machines.
No impairment was observed in roadworthiness clinical trials in patients receiving desloratadine.
However, patients should be advised that, in very rare cases, drowsiness may occur which may result in impairment of ability to drive or use machines.
Pseudoephedrine sulphate is not expected to affect psychomotor performance.
In clinical trials of 414 adults, the most common adverse events reported were insomnia (8.9%), dry mouth (7.2%) and headache (3.1%).
These and other adverse events that occurred in clinical trials are listed in the following table.
