(ng 299) and patients in the 5,600 I.E. vitamin D3 group received ADROVANCE (70 mgv 2,800 I.E.) plus an additional 2,800 I.E. vitamin D3 (ng 309) once a week; additional vitamin D supplements were permitted; after 24 weeks of treatment, mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher in the 5,600 I.E. vitamin D3 group (69 ngv 27.6 ngv ml) than in the 2,800 I.E. vitamin D3 group (64 ngv 25.5 ngv ml).

In this study, mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in patients with vitamin D deficiency at the start of the study (25-hydroxyvitamin D 22.5 to 37.5 nmL) rose from 30 nmL (12.1 ngml) to 40 nmL (15.9 ngml) in the ADROVANCE (70 mgg) (n75) group and decreased from 30 nmL (12.0 ngml) at the start of the study to 26 nmL (10.4 ngml) in the Alendronate alone group (n70).

It inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, cells involved in the breakdown of bone tissue. By blocking the activity of these cells, alendronate slows bone loss. Vitamin D3 is a nutrient found in some foods, but is also produced in the skin when exposed to natural sunlight. Vitamin D3, like other forms of vitamin D, is needed for calcium uptake and normal bone formation. As patients with osteoporosis may not produce enough vitamin D3 from sun exposure, the vitamin is contained in ADROVANCE.

For this reason, Advate was compared to Recombinate in a major study of 111 patients suffering from haemophilia A to show that both medicines are equivalent. In addition, the number of bleeding episodes and the efficacy of Advate in hemostasis was evaluated on a scale from ineffective to excellent in 107 patients who received all Advate. Three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under the age of six, investigated the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and for surgery.
ADROVANCE Trials The effect of the lower dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronate 2,800 I.E. vitamin D3) on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15-week, multinational study of 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (mean serum baseline of 25-hydroxy vitamin D: 56 nmL; 22.3 nmL; range: 22.5-225 nmL; 9-90 ngml).
Due to the possible worsening of the underlying disease, alendronate should only be given under special caution in patients with active gastrointestinal diseases, such as dysphagia, esophageal disorders, gastritis, duodenitis, ulcers, or with recent (within the last year), severe gastrointestinal disorders, such as peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding, or surgical interventions in the upper gastrointestinal tract other than pyloroplasty (see Section 4.3).

Lower uric acid levels in the blood and keep them at a lower level so that crystals can no longer form, thus alleviating the symptoms of gout. If the uric acid level is kept at a low level long enough, even existing gout nodules may become smaller. How was Adenuric investigated?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Advate in the treatment and propyhlaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital deficiency of factor VIII) outweigh the risks and recommended authorisation for the placing on the market of Advate.
The first study, involving 1 072 patients, compared the efficacy of three different doses of adenuric (80, 120 and 240 mg once a day) with that of placebo (sham medicine) and allopurinol (another medicine used to treat hyperuricemia).
