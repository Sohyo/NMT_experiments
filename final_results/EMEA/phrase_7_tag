<unk> Adenuric is a medicine containing the active substance Febuxostat.
<unk> It is available as yellow, capsule shaped tablets (80 and 120 mg).
<unk> Adenuric is used to treat chronic (long term) hyperuricaemia (high levels of uric acid and urate in the blood).
<unk> Hyperuricaemia, urate crystals can form and accumulate in the joints and kidneys.
<unk> When such deposition develops in the joints and causes pain, it is called gout.
<unk> Adenuric is given to patients who already show signs of crystalline deposition, including arthritis (pain and inflammation in the joints<unk>) or rheumatological nodes (stones i. e. greater urine crystalline deposition, which may damage joints<unk> and bone).
<unk> This medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
<unk> The recommended dose of Adenuric is 80 mg once a day.
<unk> It can be taken with or regardless of meals.
<unk> Adenuric usually decreases uric acid levels in the blood within two weeks. If uric acid levels remain above 6 mg per deciliter after two to four weeks, the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day.
<unk> Attacks of gout may still occur during the first months of treatment; it is recommended that patients continue to take medicines known to prevent gout at least during the first six months of treatment with Adenuric.
<unk> Adenuric treatment should not be discontinued if a seizure of glycaemic control occurs.
<unk> Adenuric s efficacy and safety have not been studied in patients with severe renal or hepatic problems.
<unk> This medicine is not recommended in children and patients who have had an organ transplant as it has not been studied for these groups.
<unk> The active substance Feboxustat found in Adenuric decreases the formation of uric acid.
<unk> It works by inhibition of an enzyme called xanthine oxidase, which is necessary for uric acid production in the body.

<unk> Adenuric effects were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
<unk> Adenuric efficacy was studied in two main studies in a total of 1,834 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout.
<unk> In the first trial involving 1,072 patients, the efficacy of three different adenuric doses (80, 120 and 240mg once a day) was compared with that of placebo (apparent) and Allopurinol (another medicine used to treat hyperuricaemia).
<unk> In the second trial, two doses of Adenuric (80 and 120 mg once a day) for one year in 762 patients were compared with allopurinol.
<unk> In both trials, 300 mg was administered once a day; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day.
<unk> The main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients whose uric acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg/ dl in the last three measures<unk>
<unk> <unk> The uric acid level in the blood was measured each month.
<unk> What benefit has Adenuric shown during the studies?
<unk> Adenuric was more effective than allopurinol and placebo in lowering uric acid levels in the blood.
<unk> In the first trial, 48% (126 out of 262) of patients taking 80 mg once daily and 65% (175 out of 269) of patients taking 120 mg once daily had uric acid levels in the blood of below 6 mg/ dl.
<unk> In comparison, this was the case in 22% (60 out of 268) of the patients receiving Allopurinol and in none of the 134 receiving placebo.
<unk> The second study yielded similar results in one year.
<unk> The most common side effects with Adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 in 100 patients) are headache, diarrhoea, nausea, rash and abnormal liver values.
<unk> In particular, in patients with pre-history heart discomfort, there may also be an increased risk of some side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels.
<unk> For a full list of side effects reported with Adenuric, see the Package Leaflet.
<unk> Adenuric should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Feboxustat or to any of the excipients.
<unk> The Committee for Medicinal products for human use (CHMP) concluded that while Adenuric was more effective in lowering uric acid levels in the blood than Allopurinol, it could also pose a higher risk of side effects with the heart and blood vessels.
<unk> concluded that the benefits of Adenuric in the treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia when urate deposits had occurred outweighed the risks and recommended that marketing authorisation for Adenuric be granted.
<unk> On 21 April 2008, the European Commission authorised Adenuric to be marketed throughout the European Union.
<unk> The holder of the marketing authorisation is Beaufour Ipsen Pharma.

<unk> is a white tablet in capsule form containing two active ingredients: sodium alendronate 3 H2O (70 mg) and colecalciferol (vitamin D3, 70 micrograms equivalent to 2800 international units IU).
<unk> This medicinal product is identical to FOSAVANCE, which is already authorised in the European Union.
<unk> The manufacturer of FOSAVANCE has agreed that the scientific data of this product may also be used for ADROVANCE.
<unk> ADROVANCE is used to treat osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become fragile) in post-menopausal women who are at risk for low vitamin D levels.
<unk> ADROVANCE decreases the risk of spine and hip fractures (fractures).
<unk> This medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
<unk> The recommended dose is one tablet once a week.
<unk> The patient should take the tablet with a full glass of water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before food, drink or take other medicinal products (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).
<unk> In order to prevent irritation of the oesophagus, the patient should not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, 30 minutes after taking the tablet at the earliest.
<unk> The tablet should not be chewed or dissolve in the mouth.
<unk> Patients should also take additional calcium if intake from food is not sufficient.
<unk> For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
<unk> Bone tissue is a living tissue that is continuously renewed as old bone tissue is broken down and replaced by new bone tissue.
<unk> Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones start to become thin and fragile; there is an increased sensitivity to fracture (fractures).
<unk> This occurs when not enough new bone tissue grows to replace the natural broken down bone substance.
<unk> Osteoporosis is predominantly in post-menopausal women (after 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.
<unk> <unk> EMEA 2007 Reproduction and/ or distribution of this document is authorised for non-commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is accepted menopause) when levels of the female hormone oestrogen fall because the hormone oestrogen aids bone health.The active ingredients in ADROVANCE are alendronate and vitamin D3
<unk> Alendronate is a biphosphonate used to treat osteoporosis since the mid -nineties.
<unk> Alendronate inhibitors the activity of the osteoclasts, that are cells involved in break down bone tissue and by blocking the activity of these cells alendronate slows bone loss .<unk> <unk> D3 is a nutrient found in some foods but also produced in the skin by irradiation from natural sunlight .<unk> <unk> D3, like other forms of vitamin D, is required for calcium uptake and normal bone formation .<unk> Since osteoporosis patients may not produce enough vitamin D3 from sunlight, this vitamin is included in ADROVANCE.
<unk> Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicinal products authorised in the European Union, the company presented data from previous studies and published literature.
<unk> also carried out a study in 35 men and 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis to demonstrate the effectiveness of ADROVANCE in increasing vitamin D levels.
<unk> Patients received either ADROVANCE or only alendronate once a week.
<unk> The main measure of effectiveness was the percentage of patients with low vitamin D levels.
<unk> What benefit has ADROVANCE shown during the studies?
<unk> After 15 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower (11%) than for those receiving alendronate alone (32%).
<unk> The company also presented data demonstrating that the alendronate dose included in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose required to prevent bone loss.
<unk> The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 in 100 patients) are headache, locomotor system pain (muscle, bone or joints) and digestive system symptoms such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (indigestion), constipation, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (flatulence), ulcers (ulcera), dysphagia (swallowing difficulties), inflated abdomen (bloated abdomen), and acid inflammation.
<unk> For a full list of side effects reported with ADROVANCE, see the Package Leaflet.
<unk> In patients with hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the excipients, ADROVANCE should not be used.
<unk> It should not be used in oesophageal disorders, in patients with hypocalcaemia (low calcium levels), or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.

<unk> Treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in patients at risk of vitamin D deficiency.
<unk> ADROVANCE decreases the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.
<unk> The recommended dose is one ADROVANCE tablet once a week.
<unk> Because of the course of disease in osteoporosis, ADROVANCE is intended for long term therapy.
<unk> For information to ensure adequate absorption of alendronate:
<unk> ADROVANCE should be taken only with water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before your first meal, drink or take any medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.
<unk> Other beverages (including mineral water), food and some medicinal products may affect the absorption of alendronate (see section 4.5).
<unk> The following instructions are to be followed closely in order to reduce the risk of oesophageal irritation and associated side effects (see section 4.4):
<unk> ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) when starting the day .<unk> <unk> Do not chew the tablet or allow the tablet to dissolve in the mouth because of the risk for oropharyngeal ulcera<unk> s. <unk> <unk> Patients should not lie down before the first food intake of the day, not until 30 minutes after taking the tablet at the earliest.
<unk> Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking ADROVANCE. ADROVANCE should not be taken before bedtime or before first rising of the day.
<unk> Patients should be supplemented with calcium if insufficient food is provided (see section 4.4).
<unk> Additional supplementation with vitamin D should be considered individually with consideration for vitamin D uptake by vitamin D supplements and supplements.
<unk> The equivalent of taking 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 once a week in ADROVANCE and 400 IU of vitamin D once a day has not been investigated.
<unk> In clinical trials there was no age dependent difference in the efficacy or safety profile of alendronate.
<unk> Therefore, a dose adjustment is not necessary in elderly patients.
<unk> For patients with a Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of greater than 35 ml/ min, a dose adjustment is not necessary.
<unk> ADROVANCE is not recommended for patients with impaired renal function with a GFR below 35 ml/ min due to lack of experience.
<unk> ADROVANCE has not been studied in children and adolescents and therefore should not be used in them.
<unk> Hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients or excipients. Oesophagus disorders and other factors that delay oesophageal emptying, such as stricture or achalasia. inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes. Hypocalcaemia.
<unk> Alendronate Alendronate may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosae.
<unk> Because of possible worsening of the underlying condition, special care should be taken with alendronate in patients with active gastrointestinal disorders such as dysphagia, oesophagus, gastritis, duodenitis, ulceration, or with recent (within the last year), severe gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcus, active gastrointestinal haemorrhage or upper gastrointestinal surgery except pyloroplastic (see section 4.3).
<unk> Oesophhageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcera and oesophageal erosion, rare followed by oesophageal stricture, have been reported in patients taking alendronate (in some cases they were severe and required hospitalisation).
<unk> Physicians should therefore be alert to all signs and symptoms indicating possible oesophageal reaction, and patients should be advised to discontinue and seek medical advice if symptoms of oesophageal irritation such as dysphagia, retrostaral pain or new or worsening heartburn (see section 4.8).
<unk> The risk of severe oeshageal side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and/ or continue taking it after symptoms appear that indicate oesophageal irritation.
<unk> It is very important that all dose instructions are relayed to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).
<unk> Patients should be advised that the risk of oesophageal problems may be increased if they do not obey these instructions.
<unk> While no increased risk was detected in large scale clinical trials of alendronate, rare (post-marketing) stomach and duodenal ulcers, including some severe and with complications, have been reported (see section 4.8).
<unk> Osteonecrosis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose regimens mainly contain intravenously administered bisphosphonates.
<unk> Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
<unk> Osteonecrosis of the jaw has also been reported in osteoporosis patients receiving oral bisphosphonates.
<unk> If patients exhibit appropriate risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, periodontitis), dental checkups with appropriate preventive measures should be preceded by bisphosphonates.
<unk> These patients should avoid jaw surgery as possible during treatment.
<unk> If patients develop osteonecrosis of the jaw during bisphosphonate therapy, jaw surgery may lead to worsening.
<unk> No data are available to provide evidence whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy in patients needing jaw surgery decreases the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
<unk> Clinical evaluation by the physician determines treatment planning in each patient on the basis of an individual benefit/ risk assessment.
<unk> Bone, joint and/ or muscle pain have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients.
<unk> post-marketing experience, these symptoms were rare severe and/ or associated with mobility impairment (see section 4.8).
<unk> The timing of these symptoms varied from one day to several months after initiation of therapy.
<unk> In most patients symptoms decreased after discontinuation of therapy.
<unk> Some of the patients relapsed when therapy with the same medicine or with another bisphosphonate was resumed.
<unk> Patients should be told that if they fail to take a dose of ADROVANCE, they should take the tablet the following morning after noticing their failure.
<unk> Do not take two tablets on the same day, but continue taking one tablet per week as planned on the scheduled weekday.
<unk> ADROVANCE is not recommended for renal failure patients with a GFR below 35 ml/ min (see section 4.2).
<unk> Other possible causes of osteoporosis besides oestrogen deficiency and age should be considered.
<unk> Existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected before ADROVANCE therapy is initiated (see section 4.3).
<unk> Other disorders that affect mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be adequately treated prior to the initiation of therapy with ADROVANCE.
<unk> The vitamin D level of ADROVANCE is not indicated to treat vitamin D deficiency.
<unk> In patients with these disorders, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcaemia should be monitored under ADROVANCE therapy.
<unk> Due to stimulation of bone minerisation by alendronate, decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur.
<unk> However, rare, and some severe, cases have been reported that often occurred in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (e. g. hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption) (see section 4.8).
<unk> Colecalciferol vitamin D3 may increase the extent of hypercalcaemia and/ or hypercalciuria when given to patients with illnesses associated with uncontrolled overproduction of calcitriol (e. g. leucaemia, lymphocytes, sarcoidosis).
<unk> In these patients urine and serum calcium should be monitored.
<unk> Patients with malabsorption may not absorb sufficient vitamin D3.
<unk> Excipients This medicinal product contains lactose and sucrose.
<unk> Patients with rare hereditary fructose intolerance, galactose intolerance, lapp lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
<unk> Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions<unk>
<unk> Alendronate food and drink (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicinal products may affect the absorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.
<unk> Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking other medicinal products (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
<unk> Other clinically relevant interactions with medicinal products are not to be expected.
<unk> In clinical trials, several patients received estrogen (inextraaginal, transdermal or oral) concomitantly with alendronate.
<unk> Adverse reactions attributable to this combined use have not been observed.
<unk> Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, in clinical trials alendronate was taken concomitantly with a variety of usually prescribed medicinal products without clinically relevant interactions occurring.
<unk> Cholestyramine, colestiol) may affect the absorption of vitamin D.
<unk> Anticonvulsants, cimetidine and thiazides may increase the breakdown metabolism of vitamin D.
<unk> Additional supplementation with vitamin D should be considered individually.
<unk> ADROVANCE is for use in post-menopausal women only and therefore should not be used during pregnancy or by lactating women.
<unk> There are no adequate data on the use of ADROVANCE in pregnant women.
<unk> Animal studies with alendronate show no evidence of direct harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic or post-natal development.
<unk> Alendronate administered to pregnant rats induced dystokia associated with hypocalcaemia (see section 5.3).
<unk> Animal studies have shown hypercalcaemia and reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
<unk> It is not known whether alendronate is given in human milk.
<unk> Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites are absorbed by human milk.
<unk> 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
<unk> No trials of ability to drive or use machines have been carried out.
<unk> However, there is no information to suggest that ADROVANCE disrupts ability to drive or use machines.

<unk> Rare: severe musculosskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain (see section 4.4).
<unk> Rare: symptomatic hypocalcaemia, usually in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (see section 4.4).
<unk> Rare: transient symptoms of acute phase reaction (myalgia, discomfort and rare fever), usually at the start of therapy.
<unk> Following reactions have been reported (frequency not known):
<unk> Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in bisphosphonate patients; most reports are from cancer patients, but it has also been reported in osteoporosis patients.
<unk> Osteonecrosis of the jaw is usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis).
<unk> Cancer diagnoses, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also considered risk factors (see section 4.4) .<unk>
<unk> Laboratory values In clinical trials, asymptomatic, mild and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18% and 10%, respectively, of those taking alendronate 10 mg/ day, versus approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo.
<unk> However, decreases in serum calcium to <unk> 8.0 mg/ dl (2.0 mmol/ l) and serum phosphate to 2.0 mg/ dl (0.65 mmol/ l) occurred in both treatment groups with a similar frequency.
<unk> Alendronate Following oral overdose, hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia and upper gastrointestinal side effects such as stomach upsets, heartburn, oesophagitis, gastritis or ulcera may occur.
<unk> Specific experience in the treatment of overdose with alendronate has not been presented.
<unk> If an overdose with ADROVANCE occurs, milk or antacids should be administered to bind to alendronate.
<unk> Because of the risk of oesophageal irritation, vomiting should not be initiated and the patient should remain upright.

<unk> The bone that is formed during therapy with alendronate is of normal quality.
<unk> Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the transformation of 7-dehydrocholesterol into vitamin D3.
<unk> If insufficient exposure to the light of day, it is important that vitamin D3 is included in food.
<unk> vitamin D3 undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and is stored until required.
<unk> Conversion to the active calcium mobilising hormone 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) in the kidney is strictly regulated.
<unk> The main effect of 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and to regulate serum calcium, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.
<unk> vitamin D3 is necessary for normal bone formation.
<unk> A vitamin D deficiency occurs when exposure to the sun and intake of food are insufficient.
<unk> deficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, bone loss and an increased risk of skeleton fracture.
<unk> In severe cases, deficiency may lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphataemia, proximal muscle weakness and osteomalacia, and thus further increase the risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic patients.

<unk> ADROVANCE The effect of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronate / 2,800 IU of vitamin D3) on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15-week, multinational trial in 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis (mean serum baseline of 25-hydroxyvitamin D: 56 nmol/ l <unk> 22.5 225 nmol/ l <unk> 9 90 ng/ ml <unk>).
<unk> Patients received lower strength (70 mg / 2,800 IU) (n<unk> 350) or FOSAMAX (alendronate) 70 mg once a week (n<unk> 332); no other vitamin D supplements were indicated.
<unk> After 15 weeks of treatment, mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher (26%) in the ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (56 nmol/ l / 23 ng/ ml <unk>) than in the alendronate group alone (46 nmol/ l <unk> 18.2 ng/ ml <unk>).

<unk> Regarding mean levels of serum calcium, phosphate or calcium in 24-hour urine, there were no differences between treatment groups.
<unk> Alendronate The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate given weekly 70 mg (n<unk> 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n<unk> 370) has been demonstrated in a one-year multi-centre study in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.
<unk> Elevations above baseline lumbar spine BMD were 5.1% (95% CI:
<unk> 4.8, 5.4%) in the 70 mg once a week group and 5.4% (95% CI:
<unk> 5.0, 5.8%) in the 10 mg daily group.
<unk> Mean BMD increases were 2.3% and 2.9% at the femoral neck and 2.9% and 3.1% at the total hip in the 70 mg once a week and 10 mg daily respectively.
<unk> 8 treatment groups were also similar in their BMD increases at other skeleton sites.
<unk> Alendronate effects on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design (n<unk> 944) and in the Fracture Intervention Study (FIT: n<unk> 6.459).
<unk> In the phase III trials, mean increases in BMD with alendronate 10 mg/ day versus placebo at 3 years were 8.8% in the spine, 5.9% in the femoral neck and 7.8% in the trochanter.
<unk> BMD of the total skeleton also increased significantly.
<unk> In the alendronate treated group, a 48% reduction (alendronate 3.2% versus placebo 6.2%) was achieved in the proportion of patients who sustained one or more vertebral fractures.
<unk> In the two year prolongation of these trials, spine and trochanter BMD increases continued; and femoral neck and body BMD was maintained.
<unk> FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled trials in which alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily for two years and then 10 mg daily for either 1 or 2 years):
<unk> FIT 1: a three year study in 2,027 patients with at least one pre-existing vertebral <unk> compression <unk> fracture.
<unk> In this study, daily administration of alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).
<unk> In addition, significant reductions in hip fracture incidence (1.1% versus 2.2%; reduction of 51%) were observed.
<unk> FIT 2: a four-year study in 432 low bone mass patients but without pre-existing vertebral fracture.
<unk> In this study, significant difference in the incidence of hip fracture (alendronate 1.0% versus placebo 2.2%; reduction by 56%) and in the incidence of at least one vertebral fracture (2.9% versus 5.8%; reduction by 50%) was observed in the analysis of the subgroup of osteoporotic women (37% of the total who suffered from osteoporosis as defined above).
<unk> Absorption Regarding a reference intravenous dose, the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nocturnal fasting and two hours before inclusion of a standardised breakfast.
<unk> Bioavailability decreased accordingly to about 0.46% and 0.39% when alendronate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast.
<unk> In osteoporosis studies, alendronate was effective if taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.
<unk> The alendronate constituent of the ADROVANCE combination tablet (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) and the tablet of 70 mg alendronate are bioequivalent.
<unk> Bioavailability was minimal when alendronate was administered with or up to two hours after a standardised breakfast.
<unk> Concomitant administration of alendronate with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60 <unk>.
<unk> In healthy subjects, oral prednisone administration (20 mg 3 times daily for five days) did not lead to a clinically important change in oral bioavailability of alendronate (an average increase of 20% to 44%).
<unk> Distribution Studies in rats have shown that alendronate transiently distributes to soft tissue after intravenous administration of 1 mg/ kg, but is then rapidly redistributed to bone or excreted in the urine.
<unk> <unk> The mean steady-state<unk> s volume of distribution, excluding bone, is at least 28 litres in humans.
<unk> 5 ng/ ml <unk> plasma concentrations after oral therapeutic doses of alendronate are too low for analytical detection (<unk> 5 ng/ ml).
<unk> protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78 <unk>.
<unk> Biotransformation No evidence exists that indicates that alendronate is metabolised in animals or humans.
<unk> After intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C-alendronate, approximately 50% of the radiolabelled substance were excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was recovered in the faeces.
<unk> After intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml/ min<unk> s and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml/ min<unk>
<unk> plasma concentrations fell by more than 95% within six hours after intravenous administration.
<unk> The terminal half-life in humans is estimated over 10 years after alendronate release from the skeleton.
<unk> Alendronate is not excreted in rats via the acidic or alkaline transport system and is therefore not thought to affect excretion of other medicinal products by these transport systems in humans.
<unk> Absorption In healthy adult subjects (women and men), after ADROVANCE was administered at night and two hours before meal, the mean area below the serum concentration time (AUC0 -120 h) for vitamin D3 was 296.4 ng h/ ml (excluding endogenous vitamin D3 levels).
<unk> The mean maximum concentration in the serum (Cmax) of vitamin D3 was 5.9 ng/ ml and the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (Tmax) was 12 hours.
<unk> The bioavailability of 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 in ADROVANCE is similar to that of 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 alone.
<unk> After absorption, vitamin D3 is absorbed by the blood as a substance in chylomicrons.
<unk> D3 is rapidly distributed, mainly to the liver, where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the main storage form.
<unk> A small amount distributes to fat and muscle tissue and is stored there as vitamin D3 for later release into the circulation.
<unk> Circulating vitamin D3 is bound to vitamin D-binding protein.
<unk> Biotransformation vitamin D3 is rapidly hydroxylated by the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and then metabolised by the kidneys to 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the biologically active form.
<unk> Before excretion, further hydroxylation occurs.
<unk> A small fraction of vitamin D3 is glucuronised before excretion.
<unk> Excretion When radiolabelled vitamin D3 was administered to healthy subjects, the mean excretion of radioactivity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4%, in the faeces after four days 4.9 <unk>
<unk> In both cases, radioactivity was excreted almost exclusively as metabolites of the starting substance.
<unk> The mean half-life of vitamin D3 in the serum is approximately 24 hours after an oral dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU).
<unk> Characteristics in patients Preclinical studies have shown that alendronate not deposited in bone is rapidly excreted through the urine.
<unk> No evidence of saturation of bone absorption after long term doses of cumulative intravenous doses up to
<unk> 10 35 mg/ kg in animals and although no clinical data on it is expected that, as in animal studies, renal elimination of alendronate will also be reduced in patients with impaired renal function.
<unk> Therefore, in patients with impaired renal function, somewhat increased accumulation of alendronate in bone may be expected (see section 4.2).
<unk> No non-clinical trials were carried out with a combination of alendronate and colecalciferol.
<unk> Alendronate Non-clinical data based on conventional safety pharmacology, chronic toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential show no specific dangers for humans.
<unk> Studies in rats indicated that alendronate administration to pregnant rats has been associated with dystokia in the parents<unk> due to hypocalcaemia.

<unk> The recommended dose is one ADROVANCE tablet once a week.
<unk> Because of the course of disease in osteoporosis, ADROVANCE is intended for long term therapy.
<unk> For information to ensure adequate absorption of alendronate:
<unk> ADROVANCE should be taken only with water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before your first meal, drink or take any medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.
<unk> Other beverages (including mineral water), food and some medicinal products may affect the absorption of alendronate (see section 4.5).
<unk> The following instructions are to be followed closely in order to reduce the risk of oesophageal irritation and associated side effects (see section 4.4):
<unk> ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) when starting the day .<unk> <unk> Do not chew the tablet or allow the tablet to dissolve in the mouth because of the risk for oropharyngeal ulcera<unk> s. <unk> <unk> Patients should not lie down before the first food intake of the day, not until 30 minutes after taking the tablet at the earliest.
<unk> Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking ADROVANCE. ADROVANCE should not be taken before bed or before first rising of the day.
<unk> Patients should be supplemented with calcium if insufficient food is provided (see section 4.4).
<unk> The equivalent of taking 5,600 IU

<unk> In clinical trials there was no age dependent difference in the efficacy or safety profile of alendronate.
<unk> Therefore, a dose adjustment is not necessary in elderly patients.
<unk> For patients with a Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of greater than 35 ml/ min, a dose adjustment is not necessary.
<unk> ADROVANCE is not recommended for patients with impaired renal function with a GFR below 35 ml/ min due to lack of experience.
<unk> ADROVANCE has not been studied in children and adolescents and therefore should not be used in them.
<unk> Hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients or excipients. Oesophagus disorders and other factors that delay oesophageal emptying, such as stricture or achalasia. inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes. Hypocalcaemia.
<unk> Alendronate Alendronate may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosae.
<unk> Because of possible worsening of the underlying condition, special care should be taken with alendronate in patients with active gastrointestinal disorders such as dysphagia, oesophagus, gastritis, duodenitis, ulceration, or with recent (within the last year), severe gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcus, active gastrointestinal haemorrhage or upper gastrointestinal surgery except pyloroplastic (see section 4.3).
<unk> Oesophhageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcera and oesophageal erosion, rare followed by oesophageal stricture, have been reported in patients taking alendronate (in some cases they were severe and required hospitalisation).
<unk> Physicians should therefore be alert to all signs and symptoms indicating possible oesophageal reaction, and patients should be advised to discontinue and seek medical advice if symptoms of oesophageal irritation such as dysphagia, retrostaral pain or new or worsening heartburn (see section 4.8).
<unk> The risk of severe oesophageal side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and/ or continue taking it after symptoms appear that indicate oesophageal irritation.
<unk> It is very important that all dose instructions are relayed to the patient and understood by the patient
<unk> 14 (see section 4.2) .Patients should be advised that the risk of oesophageal problems may be increased if they do not obey these instructions.
<unk> While no increased risk was detected in large scale clinical trials of alendronate, rare (post-marketing) stomach and duodenal ulcers, including some severe and with complications, have been reported (see section 4.8).
<unk> Osteonecrosis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose regimens mainly contain intravenously administered bisphosphonates.
<unk> Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
<unk> Osteonecrosis of the jaw has also been reported in osteoporosis patients receiving oral bisphosphonates.
<unk> If patients exhibit appropriate risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, periodontitis), dental checkups with appropriate preventive measures should be preceded by bisphosphonates.
<unk> These patients should avoid jaw surgery as possible during treatment.
<unk> If patients develop osteonecrosis of the jaw during bisphosphonate therapy, jaw surgery may lead to worsening.
<unk> No data are available to provide evidence whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy in patients needing jaw surgery decreases the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
<unk> Clinical evaluation by the physician determines treatment planning in each patient on the basis of an individual benefit/ risk assessment.
<unk> Bone, joint and/ or muscle pain have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients.
<unk> post-marketing experience, these symptoms were rare severe and/ or associated with mobility impairment (see section 4.8).
<unk> The timing of these symptoms varied from one day to several months after initiation of therapy.
<unk> In most patients symptoms decreased after discontinuation of therapy.
<unk> Some of the patients relapsed when therapy with the same medicine or with another bisphosphonate was resumed.
<unk> Patients should be told that if they fail to take a dose of ADROVANCE, they should take the tablet the following morning after noticing their failure.
<unk> Do not take two tablets on the same day, but continue taking one tablet per week as planned on the scheduled weekday.
<unk> ADROVANCE is not recommended for renal failure patients with a GFR below 35 ml/ min (see section 4.2).
<unk> Other possible causes of osteoporosis besides oestrogen deficiency and age should be considered.
<unk> Existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected before ADROVANCE therapy is initiated (see section 4.3).
<unk> Other disorders that affect mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be adequately treated prior to the initiation of therapy with ADROVANCE.
<unk> The vitamin D level of ADROVANCE is not indicated to treat vitamin D deficiency.
<unk> In patients with these disorders, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcaemia should be monitored under ADROVANCE therapy.
<unk> Due to stimulation of bone minerisation by alendronate, decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur.
<unk> However, rare cases, some 15 severe, have been reported and frequently occurred in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (e. g. hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption) (see section 4.8).
<unk> Colecalciferol vitamin D3 may increase the extent of hypercalcaemia and/ or hypercalciuria when given to patients with illnesses associated with uncontrolled overproduction of calcitriol (e. g. leucaemia, lymphocytes, sarcoidosis).
<unk> In these patients urine and serum calcium should be monitored.
<unk> Patients with malabsorption may not absorb sufficient vitamin D3.
<unk> Excipients This medicinal product contains lactose and sucrose.
<unk> Patients with rare hereditary fructose intolerance, galactose intolerance, lapp lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
<unk> Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions<unk>
<unk> Alendronate food and drink (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicinal products may affect the absorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.
<unk> Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking other medicinal products (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
<unk> Other clinically relevant interactions with medicinal products are not to be expected.
<unk> In clinical trials, several patients received estrogen (inextraaginal, transdermal or oral) concomitantly with alendronate.
<unk> Adverse reactions attributable to this combined use have not been observed.
<unk> Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, in clinical trials alendronate was taken concomitantly with a variety of usually prescribed medicinal products without clinically relevant interactions occurring.

<unk> Anticonvulsants, cimetidine and thiazides may increase the breakdown metabolism of vitamin D.
<unk> Additional supplementation with vitamin D should be considered individually.
<unk> ADROVANCE is for use in post-menopausal women only and therefore should not be used during pregnancy or by lactating women.
<unk> There are no adequate data on the use of ADROVANCE in pregnant women.
<unk> Animal studies with alendronate show no evidence of direct harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic or post-natal development.
<unk> Alendronate administered to pregnant rats induced dystokia associated with hypocalcaemia (see section 5.3).

<unk> Cancer diagnoses, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also considered risk factors (see section 4.4) .<unk>
<unk> Laboratory values In clinical trials, asymptomatic, mild and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18% and 10%, respectively, of those taking alendronate 10 mg/ day, versus approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo.
<unk> However, decreases in serum calcium to <unk> 8.0 mg/ dl (2.0 mmol/ l) and serum phosphate to 2.0 mg/ dl (0.65 mmol/ l) occurred in both treatment groups with a similar frequency.

<unk> Specific experience in the treatment of overdose with alendronate has not been presented.
<unk> If an overdose with ADROVANCE occurs, milk or antacids should be administered to bind to alendronate.
<unk> Because of the risk of oesophageal irritation, vomiting should not be initiated and the patient should remain upright.

<unk> is a combination tablet with the two active ingredients sodium alendronate 3 H2O and colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
<unk> Alendronate Sodium alendronate 3 H2O is a bisphosphonate that inhibitors bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts without exerting a direct effect on bone formation.
<unk> Preclinical studies indicated that alendronate preferably concentrates at the sites of active absorption.
<unk> The activity of the osteoclasts is inhibited, but recruitment and binding of the osteoclasts is not affected.
<unk> The bone that is formed during therapy with alendronate is of normal quality.
<unk> 18 Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the transformation of 7-dehydrocholesterol into vitamin D3.
<unk> If insufficient exposure to the light of day, it is important that vitamin D3 is included in food.
<unk> vitamin D3 undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and is stored until required.
<unk> Conversion to the active calcium mobilising hormone 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) in the kidney is strictly regulated.
<unk> The main effect of 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and to regulate serum calcium, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.
<unk> vitamin D3 is necessary for normal bone formation.
<unk> A vitamin D deficiency occurs when exposure to the sun and intake of food are insufficient.
<unk> deficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, bone loss and an increased risk of skeleton fracture.
<unk> In severe cases, deficiency may lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphataemia, proximal muscle weakness and osteomalacia, and thus further increase the risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic patients.

<unk> In the alendronate treated group, a 48% reduction (alendronate 3.2% versus placebo 6.2%) was achieved in the proportion of patients who sustained one or more vertebral fractures.
<unk> In the two year prolongation of these trials, spine and trochanter BMD increases continued; and femoral neck and body BMD was maintained.
<unk> FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled trials in which alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily for two years and then 10 mg daily for either 1 or 2 years):
<unk> FIT 1: a three year study in 2,027 patients with at least one pre-existing vertebral <unk> compression <unk> fracture.
<unk> In this study, daily administration of alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).
<unk> In addition, significant reductions in hip fracture incidence (1.1% versus 2.2%; reduction of 51%) were observed.
<unk> FIT 2: a four-year study in 432 low bone mass patients but without pre-existing vertebral fracture.
<unk> In this study, significant difference in the incidence of hip fracture (alendronate 1.0% versus placebo 2.2%; reduction by 56%) and in the incidence of at least one vertebral fracture (2.9% versus 5.8%; reduction by 50%) was observed in the analysis of the subgroup of osteoporotic women (37% of the total who suffered from osteoporosis as defined above).

<unk> Pure contains the active substance Octocog alfa (human clotting factor VIII).
<unk> Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophisia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder induced by deficiency of factor VIII).
<unk> Advate is indicated for both short- and long-term use.
<unk> This medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
<unk> Adverse reactions should be initiated by a doctor with experience in the treatment of haemophilia<unk> s.
<unk> Advate is given by injection into a vein at a rate of up to 10 ml per minute.
<unk> The dosage and frequency of administration vary with whether or not Advate is used to treat haemorrhage or to prevent haemorrhage during surgery.
<unk> Dosage is also adjusted according to the severity of haemorrhage and type of surgery.
<unk> Detailed information on how to calculate doses is available in the Package Leaflet.
<unk> The active substance in Advate, Octocog alfa, is a protein of the blood clotting factor.
<unk> VIII is one of the substances (factors) in the body that are involved in blood clotting.
<unk> Patients with haemophisia A suffer from factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in the joints<unk> <unk> muscle or internal organs.
<unk> Advate is used to make up for the lack of factor VIII.
<unk> Corrects for factor VIII deficiency and allows temporary control of bleeding disorder.
<unk> Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced by a method known as recombinant DNA technology:

<unk> Reproduction is authorised provided the source is accepted. How has Advate been studied? <unk> <unk> Recombinate is similar to another medicinal product authorised in the European Union but is produced in a different way and contains no human or animal source proteins.
<unk> Therefore, in one main study in 111 patients with haemophisia A, Advate was compared with Recombinate to show that both medicinal products are equivalent. In the study, in addition, in 107 patients who received all advates, the number of bleeding episodes and the effectiveness of advate in haemostasis on a scale from effective to excellent were assessed .<unk> <unk> Three additional trials in patients with severe to moderate haemophiia A, including a trial in 53 children under six years of age, investigated the use of the medicinal product for preventing bleeding and surgery.
<unk> What benefit has Advate shown during the studies?
<unk> In the main study, Advate s efficacy in preventing haemorrhage in 86% of 510 new bleeding episodes was described as excellent and well assessed.
<unk> In addition, in 81% of these bleeding episodes only one treatment with Advate was necessary.
<unk> In the additional trials, including the trial in children less than six years of age, advate s efficacy was confirmed.
<unk> Patients with haemophisia A may produce antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII.
<unk> An antibody is a protein produced by the body due to its natural protective mechanism in reaction to unknown substances.
<unk> If antibodies develop, the effectiveness of Advate is not assured.
<unk> The most common side effects with Advate (observed in 1 to 10 in 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII.
<unk> Some patients treated with medicines containing factor VIII have been observed to exhibit hypersensitivity (allergic reaction).
<unk> For a full list of side effects reported with Advate, see the Package Leaflet.
<unk> Advate should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or to any of the excipients.

<unk> isolated patients may be different in their reaction to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-lifetimes.
<unk> Prophylaxis Long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophisia A doses of factor VIII per kg body weight should be administered 2-3 days apart.
<unk> In patients less than 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 3 4 times a week is recommended.
<unk> Patients should be monitored on a regular basis for the formation of inhibitors against factor VIII.
<unk> If the expected plasma activity is not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test should be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.

<unk> If these symptoms occur, patients should discontinue treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
<unk> In the case of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be conducted to the current medical standard (see section 4.8).
<unk> The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophisia A <unk>
<unk> These inhibitors are always biased against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, and are quantified in Bethesda units (BU) per ml of plasma by a modified Bethesda assay.
<unk> In patients developing inhibitors to factor VIII, this may result in inadequate clinical reaction.
<unk> In such cases, contacting a haemophilic centre is recommended.
<unk> The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the level of exposure to factor VIII, with the highest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and dependent on genetic and other factors.
<unk> In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
<unk> In pre-treated patients (PTPS) with more than 100 days of exposure and history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (low tiered) inhibitors has been observed after transfer from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
<unk> All patients treated with blood clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.

<unk> Pharmacotherapeutic group:
<unk> of Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and von-Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant blood clotting factor VIII (Octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to glycoprotein found in human plasma.
<unk> Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein which consists of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 280 kD.
<unk> When Octocog alfa is given, it attaches to the endogenous von-Willebrand factor in the blood stream.
<unk> Activated factor VIII acts as cofactor for activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X<unk>
<unk> Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
<unk> This then releases fibrin from fibrin and clotting can occur.
<unk> Haemophisia A is a sexed, hereditary blood clotting disorder due to decreased factor VIII levels.
<unk> This, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma, results in severe bleeding in joints, muscle or internal organs.
<unk> Plasma levels are increased by substitution therapy, therefore<unk> s correction for factor VIII deficiency and tendency to bleed occurs.

<unk> Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy vary with the degree of factor VIII deficiency, the site and extent of bleeding and patient clinical condition.
<unk> Needs Treatment The factor VIII dose is presented in international units (IU) corresponding to the WHO standard for factor VIII products.
<unk> VIII activity in plasma is presented as either a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the international standard for factor VIII in plasma).
<unk> One IU of factor VIII activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in a ml of normal human plasma.
<unk> The calculation of the required factor VIII dose is based on empirical evidence that 1 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight increases<unk> VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
<unk> The required dose is calculated by the following formula:
<unk> Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII increase (%) x 0.5

<unk> The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
<unk> In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) may be necessary higher doses than those calculated with the formulation.
<unk> during treatment, adequate control of the dose and frequency of injections is recommended in order to determine factor VIII plasma concentrations.
<unk> Particular attention to substitution therapy by detection of factor VIII activity in plasma is indispensable, especially in major surgery.
<unk> isolated patients may be different in their reaction to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-lifetimes.
<unk> Prophylaxis Long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophisia A doses of factor VIII per kg body weight should be administered 2-3 days apart.
<unk> In patients less than 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 3 4 times a week is recommended.
<unk> Patients should be monitored on a regular basis for the formation of inhibitors against factor VIII.
<unk> If the expected plasma activity is not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test should be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
<unk> In patients with high inhibitor levels, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures should be considered.
<unk> These therapy<unk> s should be administered only by doctors with experience in the treatment of patients with haemophilia<unk> s. See section 4.4.
<unk> ADVATE is to be administered intravenously.
<unk> If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is required prior to administration.
<unk> The rate of administration should vary with the patient and a maximum rate of injection of 10 ml/ min should not be exceeded.
<unk> In the interest of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, note down the name and batch number of the product.
<unk> Reconstitution information prior to administration, see section 6.6.
<unk> Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
<unk> As with all intravenous proteins, hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
<unk> Product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
<unk> Patients should be alert to signs of immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction, such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory discomfort (e. g. chest tightness, wheeze).
<unk> If these symptoms occur, patients should discontinue treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
<unk> In the case of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be conducted to the current medical standard (see section 4.8).
<unk> The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophisia A <unk>
<unk> These inhibitors are always biased against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, and are quantified in Bethesda units (BU) per ml of plasma by a modified Bethesda assay.
<unk> In patients developing inhibitors to factor VIII, this may result in inadequate clinical reaction.
<unk> In such cases, contacting a haemophilic centre is recommended.
<unk> The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the level of exposure to factor VIII, with the highest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and dependent on genetic and other factors.
<unk> In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
<unk> In pre-treated patients (PTPS) with more than 100 days of exposure and history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (low tiered) inhibitors has been observed after transfer from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
<unk> All patients treated with blood clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
<unk> This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial after reconstitution.
<unk> This must be considered for patients on a sodium-controlled diet.
<unk> Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions<unk>
<unk> No tests of interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been carried out.
<unk> Animal reproduction studies have not been carried out with factor VIII.
<unk> Due to rare occurrence of haemophiia A in women, no experience of using factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding.
<unk> Therefore, in pregnancy and breast-feeding, factor VIII should only be used if there is a clear indication.

<unk> If these symptoms occur, patients should discontinue treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
<unk> In the case of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be conducted to the current medical standard (see section 4.8).
<unk> The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophisia A <unk>
<unk> These inhibitors are always biased against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, and are quantified in Bethesda units (BU) per ml of plasma by a modified Bethesda assay.
<unk> In patients developing inhibitors to factor VIII, this may result in inadequate clinical reaction.

<unk> Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophisia A (innate factor VIII deficiency).
<unk> ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von-Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated for the treatment of von-Willebrand Juergen Syndrome.
<unk> Treatment should be given under the supervision of a doctor familiar with the treatment of haemophilia<unk>
<unk> Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy vary with the degree of factor VIII deficiency, the site and extent of bleeding and patient clinical condition.
<unk> Needs Treatment The factor VIII dose is presented in international units (IU) corresponding to the WHO standard for factor VIII products.
<unk> VIII activity in plasma is presented as either a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the international standard for factor VIII in plasma).
<unk> IU of factor VIII activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in a ml of normal human plasma.
<unk> The calculation of the required factor VIII dose is based on empirical evidence that 1 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight increases<unk> VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
<unk> The required dose is calculated by the following formula:
<unk> Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII increase (%) x 0.5
<unk> In following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity during the corresponding period should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the normal or in IU/ dl).
<unk> The following Table 1 contains recommendations for dosage in case of haemorrhage and surgery:

<unk> every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients less than 6 years) for at least one day until wound healing is achieved.
<unk> Repeat injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours for patients less than 6 years) until adequate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity of 30-60% (IU/ dl).
<unk> The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
<unk> In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) may be necessary higher doses than those calculated with the formulation.
<unk> during treatment, adequate control of the dose and frequency of injections is recommended in order to determine factor VIII plasma concentrations.
<unk> Particular attention to substitution therapy by detection of factor VIII activity in plasma is indispensable, especially in major surgery.
<unk> isolated patients may be different in their reaction to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-lifetimes.
<unk> 58 Prophylaxis Long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophisia A doses of factor VIII per kg body weight should be administered 2-3 days apart.
<unk> In patients less than 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 3 4 times a week is recommended.
<unk> Patients should be monitored on a regular basis for the formation of inhibitors against factor VIII.
<unk> If the expected plasma activity is not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test should be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
<unk> In patients with high inhibitor levels, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures should be considered.
<unk> These therapy<unk> s should be administered only by doctors with experience in the treatment of patients with haemophilia<unk> s. See section 4.4.
<unk> ADVATE is to be administered intravenously.
<unk> If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is required prior to administration.
<unk> The rate of administration should vary with the patient and a maximum rate of injection of 10 ml/ min should not be exceeded.
<unk> In the interest of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, note down the name and batch number of the product.
<unk> Reconstitution information prior to administration, see section 6.6.
<unk> Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
<unk> As with all intravenous proteins, hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
<unk> Product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
<unk> Patients should be alert to signs of immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction, such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory discomfort (e. g. chest tightness, wheeze).
<unk> If these symptoms occur, patients should discontinue treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
<unk> In the case of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be conducted to the current medical standard (see section 4.8).
<unk> The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophisia A <unk>
<unk> These inhibitors are always biased against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, and are quantified in Bethesda units (BU) per ml of plasma by a modified Bethesda assay.
<unk> In patients developing inhibitors to factor VIII, this may result in inadequate clinical reaction.
<unk> In such cases, contacting a haemophilic centre is recommended.
<unk> The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the level of exposure to factor VIII, with the highest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and dependent on genetic and other factors.
<unk> In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
<unk> In pre-treated patients (PTPS) with more than 100 days of exposure and history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (low tiered) inhibitors has been observed after transfer from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
<unk> All patients treated with blood clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
<unk> This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial after reconstitution.
<unk> This must be considered for patients on a sodium-controlled diet.
<unk> Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions<unk>
<unk> No tests of interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been carried out.
<unk> Animal reproduction studies have not been carried out with factor VIII.
<unk> Due to rare occurrence of haemophiia A in women, no experience of using factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding.
<unk> Therefore, in pregnancy and breast-feeding, factor VIII should only be used if there is a clear indication.
<unk> 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
<unk> ADVATE has no effect on ability to drive and use machines.
<unk> As with any intravenous protein, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type are possible (see section 4.4).
<unk> during clinical trials with ADVATE a total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 out of 234 patients who had been treated once.
<unk> The ADRs that occurred in the most patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), all of whom occurred in previously untreated patients at higher risk of formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
<unk> 56 adverse reactions were not observed in newborns, 16 were reported in 13<unk> 32 infants, 7 in 4<unk> 56 children, 8 in 4<unk> 31 adolescents and 25 in 14<unk> 94 adults 11.

<unk> The percentage of patients was calculated by the total of individual patients (234). b) The sudden decrease in blood clotting factor VIII occurred post-surgery (10 to 14 post-surgery days) in a continuous ADVATE infusion patient.
<unk> Blood clotting was maintained throughout this period and both the plasma factor VIII and clearance rates recovered to adequate levels on the 15thpost-surgery day.
<unk> At the end of the continuous infusion, tests for factor VIII inhibitors were negative at the end of the study.
<unk> Inhibitor development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was assessed in previously treated patients.
<unk> In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 paediatric and adult 12 with confirmed severe to moderate haemophiia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrations (150 days), only one patient exhibited a low inhibitortiter (2.4 BU in modified Bethesda) at 26-day exposure with ADVATE.
<unk> Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
<unk> In addition, no FVIIII inhibitor has been detected in any of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and reported severe to moderate haemoglobin A (FVIII 2%) after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrations (50 days).
<unk> In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE formed inhibitors of factor VIII.
<unk> 4 exhibited high titers (5 Bethesda-units) and 1 exhibited low titers (<unk> 5 Bethesda-units).
<unk> <unk> The current frequency of detection of FVIII inhibitors is consistent with expectations and is within the range observed previously.
<unk> s immune response to traces of contaminating proteins has been analysed by examining antibody titers to these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.
<unk> 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 in linear regression analysis exhibited a statistically significant uptrend in titers. 4 of these patients exhibited sustained peaks or transient peaks.
<unk> One patient exhibited both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to antiCHO cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms suggesting allergic reaction or hypersensitivity occurred.
<unk> 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 in linear regression analysis exhibited a statistically significant uptrend in titers. 2 of the patients exhibited a sustained peak or a transient peak.
<unk> One patient exhibited both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to murine IgG.
<unk> In four patients uncommon occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophile granulocytes in several repeat-dose<unk> s were reported during the study.
<unk> As for other intravenous products, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency not known) have been reported at ADVATE.
<unk> Overdose symptoms associated with recombinant blood clotting factor VIII in humans are not known.
<unk> Pharmacotherapeutic group:
<unk> The factor-VIII/ of-Willebrand factor-complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and of-Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions.
<unk> contains recombinant blood clotting factor VIII (Octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to glycoprotein found in human plasma.
<unk> Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein which consists of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 280 kD.
<unk> When Octocog alfa is given, it attaches to the endogenous von-Willebrand factor in the blood stream.
<unk> Activated factor VIII acts as cofactor for activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X<unk>
<unk> Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
<unk> This then releases fibrin from fibrin and clotting can occur.
<unk> Haemophisia A is a sexed, hereditary blood clotting disorder due to decreased factor VIII levels.
<unk> This, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma, results in severe bleeding in joints, muscle or internal organs.
<unk> Plasma levels are increased by substitution therapy, therefore<unk> s correction for factor VIII deficiency and tendency to bleed occurs.
<unk> All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were carried out in pre-treated patients with severe or moderate haemophigia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
<unk> Plasma samples were evaluated in a central laboratory using a single-stage clotting test.
<unk> Pharmokinetic parameters are from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 patients who had been treated equal to or <unk> 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below.

3. How to use ADVATE 2. What should you take ADVATE for granted?
<unk> WHAT ADVATE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED For 2.<unk>
<unk> ADVATE, as a active substance, contains octocog alfa, human blood clotting factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology.
<unk> VIII is necessary to clot in the blood and therefore<unk> s to prevent bleeding.
<unk> In patients with haemophisia A (innate factor VIII deficiency) it is missing or does not function properly.
<unk> ADVATE is used to prevent or treat spontaneous haemorrhage or haemorrhage following surgery.
<unk> ADVATE is produced without the addition of human or animal protein during the cell culture process, purification and final formulation.
<unk> BEFORE USE OF ADVATE YOU REGARDING<unk> s?
<unk> If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to Octocog alfa or to any of the excipients
<unk> If you are allergic to mouse or hamster protein.
<unk> If in doubt, ask your doctor.
<unk> Special caution when using ADVATE is necessary You should tell your doctor if you have been recently treated with factor VIII products, especially if you have developed inhibitors.
<unk> Inhibitors are neutralizing antibodies to factor VIII that reduce or control the effectiveness of ADVATE in preventing or monitoring haemorrhage.
<unk> Inhibitors are a known complication of treatment with haemophilia<unk> s.
<unk> If your bleeding cannot be controlled with ADVATE, ask your doctor immediately
<unk> There is a small possibility that you may experience anaphylactic reaction (sudden, severe, allergic reaction) to ADVATE.
<unk> should be alert to early signs of such
<unk> These symptoms may be early signs of anaphylactic shock, which may also include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness and extreme breathing difficulties.

<unk> Important information about some of the ingredients of ADVATE This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
<unk> This must be considered for patients on a sodium-controlled diet.
<unk> ADVATE treatment is initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia<unk> s.
<unk> Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or IU) dependent on your physical condition and body weight, and whether it is used to prevent or treat bleeding.
<unk> frequency will vary with how well ADVATE works for you.
<unk> Usually, replacement therapy with ADVATE is given for life.
<unk> Prevention of bleeding The usual dose of Octocog alfa is 20-40 IUper kg body weight, administered every 2-3 days.
<unk> In some cases, however, more frequent injections or higher doses may be necessary, especially in younger patients.
<unk> Treatment of bleeding Octocog alfa dose is calculated according to body weight and desired factor VIII levels.
<unk> VIII levels vary with the severity and the site of bleeding.
<unk> (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII increase (% of normal) x 0.5
<unk> If you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, inform your doctor.
<unk> Your doctor will periodically do appropriate laboratory tests to ensure that you have adequate factor VIII levels.
<unk> This is especially important for major surgery.
<unk> Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors If the expected factor VIII levels in your plasma cannot be achieved or if bleeding cannot be controlled, this may be related to the development of factor VIII I
<unk> 99 inhibitors and this will be clarified by your doctor.
<unk> You may need higher ADVATE doses or even another product to control the bleeding.
<unk> Increase the dosage of ADVATE to control your bleeding without asking your doctor.
<unk> How ADVATE is administered ADVATE is usually given by the doctor into a vein (intravenously).

<unk> Questions and answers on the retraction of the Marketing Authorisation Application for Advexin
<unk> International Freiname (INN): Contusugene ratsovec
<unk> On 17 December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited formally told the Committee for Medicinal products for human use (CHMP) that the company is withdrawing its application for marketing authorisation for advexin used to treat li-women<unk> s cancer.
<unk> Pure Red Cell Aplasia was listed as a rare disease medicinal product on 23 October 2006.
<unk> Exin is a suspension for injection containing Contusugene Ladovec, a genetically-modified virus carried by the p53-gene.
<unk> What should Advexin be used for?
<unk> Advexin should have been used to treat Li-women<unk> s cancer in patients over 18 years of age.
<unk> Li-womeni Cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in patients with Li-womeni Syndrome who have a mutation of the so called p53<unk> s gene which makes them more likely to get cancer.
<unk> Li-women<unk> s cancer can occur in many parts of the body.
<unk> However, it usually affects the chest, brain, bone or softened tissues (tissue that connects, encloses and supports other structures in the body).
<unk> The active substance in advexin, Contusugene ratsovec, is a viral vector.
<unk> This is a type of gene that has been modified to allow a gene to be carried into the cells in the body.
<unk> In Advexin, it is an adenovirus that has been modified so that it cannot produce replicas of itself and therefore does not cause infection in humans.
<unk> <unk> The gene that the virus contributes to advexin is the normal (not defective) p53 gene.
<unk> Advexin should have been injected directly into the tumours, allowing cancer cells to reproduce the normal p53<unk> s protein.
<unk> p53 protein, formed from the non-defective p53 gene present in the human body, usually contributes to restoration of damaged DNA and death of cells if DNA cannot be recovered.
<unk> Since cancer cells contain broken DNA, the p53 protein will help to recover the DNA or cause the cells to die.
<unk> In Li-Fraumeni cancer, in which the p53-gene is defective, the p53-protein does not function properly and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.
<unk> Advexin should have cured or slowed the disease by restoring the cells to their normal protective function.
<unk> What documentations has the company presented to the CHMP in support of its application?
<unk> The effects of Advexin were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
<unk> presented data from a trial in a patient who experienced Li-women<unk> s tumour, bone and brain.
<unk> The patient received 12 advexin injections over five months that were injected into some of the tumours.

<unk> Reproduction is authorised provided the source is accepted.
<unk> s efficacy was assessed by scans looking at how tumours responded to treatment and the company also presented results of several small trials looking at the effects of a dose range of advexin in various cancer types .<unk> s status at the time of retraction?
<unk> When the company withdrew its application, day 179 was achieved in the application procedure.
<unk> After the CHMP had considered the responses of the company to the questions raised, some questions were still unexplained.
<unk> A new application usually requires up to 210 days for the CHMP to evaluate.
<unk> Based on consideration of initial filings, on day 120 the CHMP produces a list of questions sent to the company.
<unk> Once the company has provided answers to these questions, they are considered by the CHMP.
<unk> Before the CHMP delivers an opinion, it may ask the company any remaining questions on day 180.
<unk> What was the CHMP recommendation at this stage?
<unk> Based on the data and responses of the company to the CHMP list of questions, there were some reservations on the part of the CHMP at the time of retraction and the Committee considered provisional that advexin could not have been approved for the treatment of Li-womeni cancer.
<unk> What were the main concerns of the CHMP?
<unk> The CHMP considered that injection of advexin into Li-women<unk> s tumours has not been sufficiently demonstrated that patients benefit from it.
<unk> The Committee also had reservations about how the medicine is processed in the body, how it is administered and the safety of the product.
<unk> In addition, the company had not demonstrated sufficiently that advexin can be produced in a dependable manner and that it is not harmful for the environment or for people who come into close contact with the patient.
<unk> What are the reasons why the company has withdrawn the application?
<unk> The letter informing EMEA of the retraction of the application can be found here.
<unk> What are the effects of the retraction for patients participating in clinical trials and / or compassionate use programmes with Advexin?
<unk> company did not tell the CHMP whether or not the retraction has effects on patients currently participating in clinical trials or compassionate use programmes with Advexin.
<unk> This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) explaining how the Committee for Medicinal products for human use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to reach recommendations on the use of the product.

<unk> Aerinaze is a medicine containing the active ingredients desloratadine (2.5 mg) and pseudoephedrine (120 mg).
<unk> It is available as blue and white altered drug release tablets. Altered drug release means that the tablets are composed to release one of the active ingredients immediately and the other slowly over a few hours.
<unk> Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hayfever, nasal inflammation induced by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (nasal constipation).
<unk> This medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
<unk> In adult and adolescents age 12 and over, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice a day is a tablet to be taken wholly with a glass of water with or without food.
<unk> The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and should be discontinued once the symptoms, especially nasal swelling (nasal constipation), have resolved.
<unk> A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine on nasal constipation may decrease.
<unk> Once the nasal is free, patients can take desloratadine alone.
<unk> Aerinaze contains two active ingredients:
<unk> <unk> desloratadine, an antihistamine, and pseudoephedrine, a nasal swelling medicine.
<unk> desloratadine blocks the receptors to which histamine, a natural substance that causes allergic symptoms, is usually attached.
<unk> If the receptors are blocked, histamine cannot produce its effect and this results in alleviation of allergic symptoms.
<unk> Pseudoephedrine stimulates the nerve endings to release the chemical mammalian substance noradrenaline, which causes constriction (constriction) of blood vessels.
<unk> As a result, less fluid is excreted from the vessels and swelling decreases and less mucus is secreted by the nose.
<unk> Aerinaze combines two active ingredients because one antihistamine medicine alone often does not provide adequate relieve of symptoms in patients with nasal constipation.
<unk> Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.
<unk> <unk> EMEA 2007 Reproduction and/ or distribution of this document is authorised for non-commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is accepted Aerinaze tablets consist of two layers, one of which contains desloratadine and the other pseudoephedrine. desloratadine is released from its layer immediately after administration, while pseudoephedrine is slowly released for 12 hours. Therefore, the tablet only has to be taken twice daily.
<unk> Aerinaze efficacy was studied in two main studies involving a total of 1,248 adult and adolescents patients.
<unk> In both studies, Aerinaze was compared with desloratadine alone and with pseudoephedrine alone.
<unk> The main measures of efficacy were changes in the severity of hayfever symptoms reported by patients prior to the initiation of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.
<unk> During the study, patients kept their symptoms in a diary every 12 hours and used a standard scale to estimate how severe the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.
<unk> What benefit has Aerinaze shown during the studies?
<unk> Aerinaze relieved symptoms more effectively than the two agents alone.
<unk> When looking at all hayfever symptoms except nasal constipation, patients taking Aerinaze reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms, compared to 35.9% for those taking pseudoephedrine alone.
<unk> When only nasal swelling was considered, patients on Aerinaze exhibited 37.4% improvement in symptoms versus 26.7% for those taking desloratadine alone.
<unk> In the second study, similar results were observed.
<unk> The most common side effects with Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 in 100 patients) are tachycardia (jaundice), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), pharyngitis (pharyngeal inflammation), anorexia (loss of appetite), constipation, headache, tiredness, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (somnolence), trouble sleeping and nervousness.
<unk> For a full list of side effects reported with Aerinaze, see the Package Leaflet.
<unk> Aerinaze should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or to any of the other ingredients, adrenergic agents or loratadine (another anti-allergic medicinal product).
<unk> It should not be used in patients taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (such as some anti-depressive medicines) or have ceased taking such a medicine within the last two weeks.
<unk> Aerinaze should also not be used in patients who have close angle hypoglycaemia (increased intramuscular pressure), urine retention (difficult urination), cardiovascular disorders including hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperthyroid disorder (thyroid hyperfunction), or have had a haemorrhagic stroke (stroke induced by cerebral haemorrhagic haemorrhagic stroke) or are at risk of a haemorrhagic stroke.
<unk> Committee for Medicinal products for human use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Aerinaze in symptomatic treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis with nasal swelling outweighed the risks and recommended that marketing authorisation for Aerinaze be granted.
<unk> On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation for Aerinaze to be marketed throughout the European Union.

<unk> The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but can be swallowed (i. e. without gnawing, breakage or chewing).
<unk> These can be taken regardless of meals.
<unk> Aerinaze should not be used in children below age 12 years due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).
<unk> The duration of administration should be as short as possible and should not be continued after symptoms have resolved.
<unk> It is recommended that the duration of administration is limited to 10 days because long term use may reduce the activity of pseudoephedrine over time.
<unk> Following decreased mucosal swelling in the upper respiratory tract, treatment with desloratadine as monotherapy can be continued as necessary.

<unk> Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, and this medicine is also contraindicated for patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAOI), and within the two weeks following the end of such therapy.
<unk> Aerinaze is also contraindicated for patients with:
<unk> <unk>
<unk> Urine retention, cardiovascular disorders such as ischaemia, tachyarrhythmia and severe hypertension, - hyperthyroidism, - a history of haemorrhagic stroke or risk factors that may increase the risk of haemorrhagic stroke .<unk> s due to the alphamimetic activity when combined with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolide, lisuride, cabergolin, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or other decongestives used perorally or nasally as a swelling rhinology (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazole, naphazolin etc.).
<unk> The recommended dosage and duration of treatment should not be exceeded (see section 4.2).
<unk> In patients over 60 years of age, adverse events are more likely to occur under sympathomimetics such as pseudoephedrine.
<unk> The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been evaluated for this patient population and the data are not sufficient to make appropriate dose recommendations.
<unk> Therefore, caution should be exercised when using the combination in patients over 60 years of age.
<unk> Aerinaze safety and efficacy have not been evaluated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and the data are not sufficient to make appropriate dosage recommendations.
<unk> The combination preparation is not recommended for use in patients with impaired renal or hepatic impairment.
<unk> Aerinaze should not be used in children below age 12 (see section 4.2).
<unk> Patients should be advised that treatment should be discontinued if hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac dysrhythmia, nausea or any other neurologic symptoms (such as headache or headache) occur.
<unk> sympathomimetic amines may cause central nervous system stimulation of seizure or cardiovascular breakdown with hypotension.
<unk> These effects are more likely in children, the elderly or in the case of overdose (see section 4.9).
<unk> Patients with hypertension Patients with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, urinary neck obstruction or history of bronchospasm should be used cautiously.
<unk> Use in patients with stenosising stomach ulcers and pyloroduodenal obstruction should be used cautiously.
<unk> Caution should also be used in patients treated with other sympathomimetics.
<unk> These include: decongestive anorectics or type 3 antihypertensive drugs, tricycle antidepressants and other antihistamines.
<unk> In addition, caution should be exercised in patients with migraine who are also treated with vascular<unk> s alkaloids.
<unk> continued use may lead to tolerance, coupled with an increased risk of overdose.
<unk> Use of mild halogenated anaesthetics during therapy with indirect sympathomimetics may lead to peripheral acute hypertension.
<unk> Therefore, in the case of surgery, it is preferable to discontinue treatment 24 hours prior to the initiation of anaesthesia.
<unk> Athletes should be advised that pseudoephedrine therapy may result in favourable drug tests.
<unk> Aerinaze should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to conducting dermatological tests because antihistamines may otherwise prevent or reduce favourable reactions to indicators of skin reaction.
<unk> Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions<unk>
<unk> However, in clinical trials with desloratadine in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were added, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in plasma concentration of desloratadine were observed.
<unk> Reversible and irreversible MAOI may increase the risk of vascular<unk> s and hypertension.

<unk> Other vasoconstipating agents used orally or nasally as debilitating rhinologic agents (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazole, naphazole etc.):
<unk> sympathomimetics may reduce the antihypertensive effect of -methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine, veratum alkaloids and guanethidine.
<unk> The rate of absorption of pseudoephedrine sulphate is increased by antacids and decreased by kaolin.
<unk> The interaction between Aerinaze and alcohol has not been studied.
<unk> In a clinical pharmacological study, concomitant administration of desloratadine and alcohol increased glycaemic control
<unk> 4 However, the effect of alcohol did not increase and no significant differences could be detected between patients treated with desloratadine and placebo, whether or not desloratadine was administered alone or with alcohol.
<unk> The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified and interactions with other medicinal products cannot be wholly excluded.
<unk> desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.
<unk> In animal studies, neither desloratadine nor the combination of loratadin and pseudoephedrine was teratogenic.
<unk> The safety of using Aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, but experience in a large number of affected pregnancies has shown no increase in the frequency of malformations compared to that in the normal population.
<unk> Since reproduction studies in animals cannot always be transmitted to humans and due to vasoconstrictory characteristics of pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.
<unk> Desloratadine and pseudoephedrine are absorbed into human milk.
<unk> Decreased milk production has been reported by breast-feeding women with pseudoephedrine.
<unk> Therefore, Aerinaze should not be administered to breast-feeding women.
<unk> 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
<unk> No studies have been carried out on the effect of Aerinaze on ability to drive and use machines.
<unk> In clinical trials to evaluate the ability<unk> s ability<unk> s), no harm was detected in patients receiving desloratadine.
<unk> However, patients should be advised that in very rare cases light-headedness may occur, which may result in impairment of ability to drive or use machines.
<unk> Pseudoephedrine sulphate is not expected to impair mental motor function.
<unk> In clinical trials involving 414 adults, the most common adverse events were insomnia (8.9%), dry mouth (7.2%) and headache (3.1%).
<unk> These and other adverse events that occurred in clinical trials are listed in the table below.
