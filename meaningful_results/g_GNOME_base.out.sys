The path from the original position to the target position must be clear, which means that you cannot jump over other objects.
A straight horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of five or more objects will be removed from the board. In this case, you will also receive an additional turn, during which no additional objects will be added to the board.
The game is over as soon as the board is fully filled, as then no object can be moved.
You score points by forming rows of five or more objects; the number of points you can score depends on the number of objects you remove.
Try to bring at least three identical objects into a line with each move.
Try to put more than five objects together. In the case of six objects, for example, you can make two consecutive lines with two or three objects and an empty space between them. On the next move, insert the sixth object.

A short introduction to the possibilities of marking with F-Spot
There are several ways to search for markers.
First method: Double click on the markers you want to search for.
Drag the markers you want to search for into the just activated search box.
To exclude a marker from your search:
Double-click the marker you want to exclude on the toolbar, and it will be added to the search bar first.
Then double-click the marker you want to exclude in the search bar.
As with adding markers, there are two basic methods to remove markers from your photos.
Select the photos from which you want to remove a marker.
Select a marker in the marker bar that you want to remove from the photos you have selected.
Right-click on the photos.
Deleting tags completely removes them from the system, but leaves behind the photos to which this tag is assigned.
Select the marker you want to remove from the marker bar.
Create markers that can be assigned to photos
To use markers at all, you must first create a set of markers. There are three basic methods for creating markers.
Select the photos to which you want to assign the new marker.
Select photos to which you want to assign a marker.
In the toolbar, select a toolbar that you want to add to the selected photos.
Rate your photos with one to five stars
Select the photo you want to rate by double-clicking.
In the lower right corner, you will see five points related to the rating to be awarded. To award an asterisk, for example, click on the first point.
Select the photo (s) to rate.
Right-click on the photo (s) to be rated and select a rating at the bottom of the context menu by clicking on the appropriate item.
To search for photos by rating stars:
Select the range of ratings for the photos to be viewed.
To stop the search for rating stars:
Select the photos you want to upload.
Imported rolls are stacks of imported photos, and regardless of the actual date the picture was taken, the timestamp of the photo's import is crucial.
To search for the latest imported role:
First, you will probably want to import photos.
Select a source for import, such as a device or folder.
You have three ways to rotate a selected photo:
Click on the corresponding spin button to the right of the import button.
Use the bracket keys to rotate the photo.
Select the angle of rotation from -45 to 45 degrees.
Select an aspect ratio, i.e. a ratio between height and width, that the new photo should correspond to. Examples of aspect ratios are 4x3, 4x6 and 5x7.
Click and drag to select the area to be preserved. You can still move this rectangle as a whole after the size has been selected.

Select an extension to install from the list.
To activate plugins that are already installed:
Select the extension you want to activate.
To disable plugins that are already installed:
Select the extension you want to disable.
Select the extension you want to uninstall.
Double-click on the photo you want to edit with the Red Eye Removal Tool.
Select the area where you want to remove red eyes. If the area contains many red areas, you may need to select each eye separately.
To automatically improve the colors of a photo:
Select the photo you want to improve by double-clicking.
Select a period of time from which you want to view photos by selecting a set period of time or by using dates.
Alternatively, you can use the timeline to:

This mode removes the colors, converting a colored image into a black and white image.
This mode simulates a photo taken with sepia tint.
This mode automatically synchronizes the colors with a set profile.
Of the editing tools in F-Spot, color matching is probably the most powerful tool. Color matching allows you to:
This simulates the extension or shortening of the exposure time.
This setting allows to adjust the color intensity in an image. Moving to the left reduces the colors up to the black-and-white image, while Moving to the right intensifies the colors.
This adjustment increases the brightness of the colors; too high a value makes colors appear blurred, while too low a value makes the image appear too dark and low in contrast.
This setting lets colors rotate along the color wheel.
This setting adjusts the contrast ratio, i.e. the difference between bright and dark pixels. Moving to the left reduces the contrast, while moving to the right increases the contrast.
This setting changes the color temperature measured in Kelvin.
This setting allows you to tint your photos with one color.
Convert to black and white with controller. Requires mono 2.2.
This extension allows you to burn your photos to a CD.
This extension allows you to export your photos to Flickr and 23hq.
This extension allows you to export your photos as HTML galleries, original galleries or to a folder.
This extension allows you to export your photos to a PHP gallery (https: / / gallery.menalto.com).
This extension allows you to export your photos to PicasaWeb.
This extension allows you to export your photos to SmugMug.
This extension allows you to export your photos to Tabblo.
NOT STABLE - Please make sure you make a backup copy of photos.db before testing this extension, which allows you to change the base path of your photos. It is very convenient to move your photos from <unk> / Photos to / OurPhotos, for example. Just make sure that SqLite can implement the changes for a few hours after f-spot reports the completion. It will only change the path to your photos in the photo folder.

To start a new game, follow these steps:
Click on one of the buttons in the toolbar.
Starts a new game with all available variants.
Launches a new game that only includes logic puzzles.
Starts a new game in which only arithmetic exercises are included.
Starts a new game consisting only of memory exercises.
Starts a new game that contains only verbal analogies.
Always read the instructions carefully when playing a game!
The game session starts with the display of the problem and the question for the answer. At the bottom of the window you will find the main control elements to control the game.

It includes various variations such as logic puzzles, brain arithmetic tasks, memory exercises, and verbal analogies designed to test different cognitive abilities.
If you answer a question incorrectly, you will receive no points.
If you answer a question correctly, you will earn points depending on the time it took to solve the problem and whether a clue was consulted during the game.
The following table summarizes the different playing times (in seconds) depending on the degree of difficulty.
Based on the time expected for the chosen difficulty level and the time required for the exercise, the following logic is used:
If you are faster than the expected time, you will score 10 points.
If you are slower than expected, you will score 8 points.
If you take more than twice as long as expected, you score 7 points.
If you take more than three times as long as expected, you score 6 points.
If you use a hint, you get only 80% of the original result.
This means that with medium difficulty you have to reach 10 points in at least 20 games of each type to get a final score of 100 points.
This may sound demanding, but it allows players to compare results from different sessions in the game history and better track the progress of the player in all completed tasks.
Use the various checkboxes below the graphic to select the results to be displayed in the graphic.
To change the number of saved game sessions or how many games are stored in the chronicle, proceed as follows:
Use the first setting box to change the number of game sessions that need to be saved, so that the results are displayed for the first time in the history graph.
The second control panel is used to change the number of game sessions shown in the history graph.
To change the difficulty of a game, proceed as follows:
Use the clues to solve a puzzle.
Some games offer simple hints that can be helpful in solving the problem.
This feature is not available for some games.
To stop a game so that you can resume it at a later time, do one of the following steps:
To resume a game after it has been paused, perform one of the following steps:

Tasks that challenge your reasoning and thinking skills. These puzzles are based on sequences of elements, visual and spatial conclusions, or relationships between elements.
Tasks based on arithmetic operations to improve your mental arithmetic skills. In these exercises, the player has to combine multiplication, division, addition and subtraction and use them in different ways.
Quests that test your short-term memory. These exercises are collections of objects that the player should remember. Sometimes, they are connections between elements, words, numbers or colors.
Games that challenge your verbal skills. These tasks challenge the player to find causes and effects, to use synonyms or opposites, and to test the vocabulary.
