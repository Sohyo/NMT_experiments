ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Pseudoephedrine stimulates nerve endings to release the chemical messenger substance noradrenaline, which causes constriction (narrowing) of blood vessels.
Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicinal products authorised in the European Union, the company presented data from previous studies and published literature.
Although no clinical data are available, renal elimination of alendronate is expected to be reduced in patients with impaired renal function, as in animal studies.

The main effect of 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and to regulate serum calcium, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were investigated in two identical design Phase II (n/ 944) and Fracture Intervention (FIT: n/ 6,459) studies.
However, rare cases of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, some severe even 15, were reported, often in patients with appropriate predisposing factors (e. g. hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption) (see section 4.8).

Adenuric is used in patients who already show signs of crystal deposits, including arthritis (pain and inflammation in the joints) or rheumatoid nodules (stones i. e. larger urine crystal deposits that can cause joint and bone damage).
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were investigated in two identical design Phase II (n/ 944) and Fracture Intervention (FIT: n/ 6,459) studies.
Caution should be exercised when treating the following populations: Digitalis patients with irregular heart rhythm Patients with hypertension Patients with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, bladder obstruction or a history of bronchospasm.
trials of alendronate The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate once weekly 70 mg (n/ 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n/ 370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicentre trial in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that while Adenuric was more effective at lowering uric acid levels in the blood than allopurinol, it could also increase the risk of heart and vascular adverse reactions.
In the Phase III-1 trials, mean increases in BMD with alendronate were 10 mg/ day versus placebo at 3 years, 8.8% in the spine, 5.9% in the femoral neck, and 7.8% in the trochanter.

Alendronate inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, cells involved in the breakdown of bone tissue. By blocking the activity of these cells, alendronate slows bone loss. Vitamin D3 is a nutrient found in some foods but also produced in the skin when exposed to natural sunlight. Vitamin D3, like other forms of vitamin D, is needed for calcium uptake and normal bone formation. As patients with osteoporosis may not produce enough vitamin D3 from sunlight, ADROVANCE contains it.

For this reason, a major study of 111 patients with haemophilia A compared Advate to Recombinate to show that both medicines are equivalent. In addition, the number of bleeding episodes and the efficacy of Advate in haemostasis were evaluated on a scale of ineffective to excellent in 107 patients receiving all Advate. Three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a trial of 53 children under six years of age, investigated the use of the medicine for preventing bleeding and for surgery.

Aerinaze should also not be used in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), urinary retention (difficult urination), cardiovascular disorders including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidism), or who have had a haemorrhagic stroke (stroke caused by cerebral haemorrhage) or are at risk of a haemorrhagic stroke.
The most common adverse reactions of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart failure), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), pharyngitis (pharyngitis), anorexia (anorexia), constipation, headache, tiredness, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (somnolence), trouble sleeping and nervousness.
In this study, a significant difference in the incidence of hip fractures (alendronate 1.0% vs. placebo 2.2%; reduction of 56%) and in the incidence of at least one vertebral fracture (2.9% vs. 5.8%; reduction of 50%) was observed in analysis of the subgroup of osteoporotic women (37% of the total number suffering from osteoporosis as defined above).

In healthy adult subjects (women and men) after ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 5,600 IU) after nocturnal fasting and two hours before meal intake, the mean surface area below the serum concentration time curve (AUC0-80 h) for vitamin D3 was 490.2 ng h/ ml (excluding endogenous vitamin D3 levels).

ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after waking up each day. Patients should not chew or allow the tablet to melt in their mouth as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcers. Patients should not lie down before their first food intake of the day, which should be 30 minutes after taking the tablet at the earliest.
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and von Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant clotting factor VIII (Octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to the glycoprotein present in human plasma.

The doctor should therefore be attentive to all signs and symptoms indicating possible oesophageal reaction and patients should be advised to discontinue the product and seek medical advice if symptoms of oesophageal irritation such as dysphagia, swallowing pain or retrostatic pain or new or worsening heartburn occur (see section 4.8).
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient exhibited a low inhibitortiter (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
