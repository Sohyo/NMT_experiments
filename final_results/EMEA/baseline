Adenuric is a medicine containing the active ingredient Febuxostat.
It is available as yellow capsule tablets (80 and 120 mg).
Adenuric is used to treat chronic (long-term) hyperuricemia (high levels of uric acid or urine in the blood).
In hyperuricemia, urine crystals can form and deposit in the joints and kidneys.
When such deposits form in the joints and cause pain, it is called gout.
Adenuric is used in patients who already show signs of crystal deposits, including arthritis (pain and inflammation in the joints) or gout nodules (stones, i.e. larger urine crystal deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage).
The medicine is only available on doctor's prescription.
The recommended dose of Adenuric is 80 mg once daily.
It can be taken with or independently of meals.
Adenuric acid usually lowers uric acid levels in the blood within two weeks. If uric acid levels still exceed 6 mg per deciliter after two to four weeks, the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day.
Attacks of gout can still occur during the first few months of treatment, so it is recommended that patients continue to take other medicines to prevent gout attacks for at least the first six months of treatment with Adenuric.
Treatment with Adenuric should not be discontinued if an attack of gout occurs.
The efficacy and safety of Adenuric were not investigated in patients with severe kidney or liver problems.
The drug is not recommended in children and patients who have had organ transplants as it has not been studied for these groups.
The active ingredient Feboxustat contained in Adenuric reduces the formation of uric acid.
It works by inhibiting an enzyme called xanthine oxidase, which is necessary for uric acid production in the body.
By reducing uric acid production, adenuric acid can reduce the

Lower uric acid levels in the blood and keep them at a lower level so that crystals can no longer form, thus alleviating the symptoms of gout. If the uric acid level is kept at a low level long enough, even existing gout nodules may become smaller. How was Adenuric investigated?
The effects of Adenuric were initially tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The efficacy of Adenuric was investigated in two main studies involving a total of 1,834 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.
The first study, involving 1 072 patients, compared the efficacy of three different doses of adenuric (80, 120 and 240 mg once a day) with that of placebo (sham medicine) and allopurinol (another medicine used to treat hyperuricemia).
In the second study, two doses of adenuric (once daily 80 and 120 mg) were compared for one year to allopurinol in 762 patients.
In both studies, allopurinol was administered at a once-daily dose of 300 mg; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day.
The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose uric acid levels in the blood were below 6 mgdL on the last three measurements.
The uric acid level in the blood was measured every month.
What are the benefits of Adenuric in these studies?
Adenuric acid was more effective in lowering uric acid levels in the blood than allopurinol and placebo.
In the first study, 48% (126 out of 262) of patients taking Adenuric at a once-daily dose of 80 mg and 65% (175 out of 269) of patients taking 120 mg once-daily had uric acid levels below 6 mg in the blood on the last three measurements.
In comparison, this was the case in 22% (60 out of 268) of the patients receiving allopurinol and in none of the 134 patients receiving placebo.
The second study produced similar results after one year.
The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, rash and abnormal liver function.
In particular, patients with a history of heart problems may also be at increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels.
The full list of adverse reactions reported in connection with Adenuric can be found in the package leaflet.
Adenuric should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to feboxustat or any of its components.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that adenuric acid was more effective than allopurinol in lowering uric acid levels in the blood, but could also pose a higher risk of heart and vascular side effects.
The Committee concluded that the benefits of Adenuric in the treatment of chronic hyperuricemia, where uranium deposits have already occurred, outweigh the risks and recommended that the marketing authorisation be granted for Adenuric.
On 21 April 2008, the European Commission authorised the placing of Adenuric on the market throughout the European Union.
The holder of the marketing authorisation is Beaufour Ipsen Pharma.

ADROVANCE is a white tablet in capsule form containing two medicinal ingredients: sodium alendronate 3 H2O (70 mg) and colecalciferol (vitamin D3, 70 micrograms corresponding to 2800 international units I.E.).
This medicine is identical to FOSAVANCE, which is already authorised in the European Union.
The manufacturer of FOSAVANCE has agreed that the scientific data of this product may also be used for ADROVANCE.
ADROVANCE is used to treat osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become brittle) in postmenopausal women who are at risk of low vitamin D levels.
ADROVANCE reduces the risk of spinal and hip fractures (fractures).
The medicine is only available on doctor's prescription.
The recommended dose is one tablet once a week.
The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).
In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should be 30 minutes after taking the tablet at the earliest.
The tablet must not be chewed or dissolved in the mouth.
Patients should also take additional calcium if insufficient intake is achieved through food.
Further information can be found in the leaflet.
Bone tissue is a living tissue that is constantly renewed by breaking down old bone tissue and replacing it with new.
Osteoporosis is a disease in which the bones gradually become thin and brittle, resulting in increased susceptibility to fractures (fractures).
This occurs when not enough new bone tissue grows to replace the naturally broken down bone.
Osteoporosis mainly occurs in postmenopausal women (according to the 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.
( 44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 Email: mail.emea.europa.eu https: / / www.emea.europa.eu EMEA 2007 Reproduction and distribution of this document is authorized for non-commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is recognized menopause) when levels of the female hormone estrogen decrease because the hormone estrogen supports bone health.
Alendronate is a biphosphonate that has been used against osteoporosis since the mid-1990s.
It inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, cells involved in the breakdown of bone tissue. By blocking the activity of these cells, alendronate slows bone loss. Vitamin D3 is a nutrient found in some foods, but is also produced in the skin when exposed to natural sunlight. Vitamin D3, like other forms of vitamin D, is needed for calcium uptake and normal bone formation. As patients with osteoporosis may not produce enough vitamin D3 from sun exposure, the vitamin is contained in ADROVANCE.
As alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicinal products authorised in the European Union, the company submitted data taken from previous studies and published literature.
The company also conducted a study with 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to demonstrate the effectiveness of ADROVANCE in increasing vitamin D levels.
Patients received either ADROVANCE or alendronate once a week.
The main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of patients with low vitamin D levels.
What benefits has ADROVANCE shown in these studies?
After 15 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower in patients treated with ADROVANCE (11%) than in those taking alendronate alone (32%).
The company also provided data showing that the dose of alendronate contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.
The most common adverse reactions (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headaches, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (indigestion), constipation, diarrhea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), ulcers (ulcers) of the esophagus, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), bloated abdomen (bloated abdomen) and acid belching.
The complete list of side effects reported in connection with ADROVANCE can be found in the package leaflet.
ADROVANCE may not be used in patients with possible hypersensitivity (allergy) to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients.
It should not be used in diseases of the esophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that the benefits of ADROVANCE in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal patients at risk of vitamin D deficiency outweigh the risks and recommended that the marketing authorisation of ADROVANCE be granted.
On 4 January 2007, the European Commission authorised Merck Sharp <unk> Dohme Ltd to market ADROVANCE throughout the European Union.
The full text of the EPAR for ADROVANCE is available here.
Each tablet contains 70 mg alendronic acid as sodium alendronate 3 H2O and 70 micrograms (2,800 I.U.) colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Each tablet contains 62 mg of lactose and 8 mg of sucrose.
See Section 6.1 for the complete list of other components.
Capsule-shaped, white to broken white tablets, marked with the outline of a bone on one side and 710 on the other.
Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in patients at risk of vitamin D deficiency.
ADROVANCE reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.
The recommended dosage is one ADROVANCE tablet once a week.
In view of the course of osteoporosis ADROVANCE is intended for long-term therapy.
Notes to ensure adequate absorption of alendronate:
ADROVANCE should only be taken with water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, drink or intake of medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.
Other beverages (including mineral water), foodstuffs and some medicinal products may affect the absorption of alendronate (see Section 4.5).
The following advice should be followed closely to reduce the risk of oesophageal irritation and associated side effects (see Section 4.4):
ADROVANCE should only be swallowed with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after waking up. Patients should not chew the tablet or let the tablet melt in their mouth as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcers. Patients should not lie down before the first food intake of the day, which should not be taken before 30 minutes after taking the tablet.
2 Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking ADROVANCE. ADROVANCE should not be taken before bedtime or before getting up for the first time of the day.
Patients should be supplemented with calcium if the food supply is not sufficient (see section 4.4).
An additional supplement with vitamin D should be considered individually, taking into account vitamin D intake by vitamin supplements and dietary supplements.
The equivalent of taking 2,800 IU vitamin D3 once a week in ADROVANCE and 400 IU vitamin D once a day was not investigated.
In clinical trials, there was no age-related difference in the efficacy or safety profile of alendronate.
Therefore, a dose adjustment is not necessary in older people.
In patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 35 mL / min, dose adjustment is not required.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for patients with impaired kidney function with a GFR below 35 mL / min due to lack of experience.
ADROVANCE has not been studied in children and adolescents and should therefore not be used in them.
Hypersensitivity to any of the medicinal ingredients or other ingredients. Esophagus disorders and other factors that delay esophageal emptying, such as strictures or achalasia. Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes. Hypocalcemia.
Alendronate Alendronate can cause local irritation of the mucous membranes of the upper gastrointestinal tract.
Due to the possible worsening of the underlying disease, alendronate should only be given under special caution in patients with active gastrointestinal diseases, such as dysphagia, esophageal disorders, gastritis, duodenitis, ulcers, or with recent (within the last year), severe gastrointestinal disorders, such as peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding, or surgical interventions in the upper gastrointestinal tract other than pyloroplasty (see Section 4.3).
Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal strictures, were reported in patients taking alendronate (sometimes severe and requiring hospitalization).
The physician should therefore pay close attention to all signs and symptoms indicating possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be advised to discontinue the medicine and seek medical advice in the event of symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain when swallowing or retrostellar pain or new or worsening heartburn (see Section 4.8).
3 The risk of severe oesophageal side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the drug correctly or continue to take it after symptoms appear that indicate oesophageal irritation.
It is very important that all dosage instructions are communicated to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).
Patients should be informed that the risk of esophageal problems may be increased if they do not follow these instructions.
While no increased risk was found in large-scale clinical trials of alendronate, stomach ulcers and duodenal ulcers, some severe and with complications, were rarely reported (see Section 4.8).
Osteonecrosis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction or local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose regimen of treatment predominantly includes intravenous bisphosphonates.
Many of these patients also received chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw was also reported in osteoporosis patients taking oral bisphosphonates.
A dental examination with appropriate preventive measures should be preceded by treatment with bisphosphonates if patients have appropriate risk factors (e.g. cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, periodontitis).
During the treatment, these patients should avoid orthodontic surgery as far as possible.
If patients develop osteonecrosis of the jaw during bisphosphonate therapy, orthodontic surgery can lead to deterioration.
There are no data available to indicate whether stopping bisphosphonate therapy in patients requiring maxillofacial surgery reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
The clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient on the basis of an individual benefit-risk assessment.
Bone, joint and muscle pain were reported in patients taking bisphosphonates.
After market introduction, these symptoms were rarely severe or associated with impairment of mobility (see Section 4.8).
The time of onset of these symptoms varied from one day to several months after the start of therapy.
In most patients, the symptoms decreased after discontinuing the therapy.
In some patients, symptoms recurred when therapy with the same drug or another bisphosphonate was resumed.
Patients should be instructed that if they fail to take a dose of ADROVANCE, they should take the tablet the next morning after noticing their failure.
You should not take two tablets on the same day, but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the designated weekday.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for patients with renal insufficiency with a GFR below 35 mL / min (see section 4.2).
Other possible causes of osteoporosis besides estrogen deficiency and age should be considered.
An existing hypocalcemia must be balanced before ADROVANCE therapy can be started (see section 4.3).
Other diseases that impair the mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with ADROVANCE.
The vitamin D content of ADROVANCE is not suitable for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency.
Patients with these diseases should have serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia monitored under ADROVANCE therapy.
4 Due to the stimulation of bone mineralization by alendronate, decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur.
However, cases of symptomatic hypocalcemia have rarely been reported, some severe, which often occurred in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (e.g. hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption) (see Section 4.8).
Colecalciferol vitamin D3 may exacerbate the extent of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria when given to patients with diseases associated with uncontrolled overproduction of calcitriol (e.g. leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoidosis).
In these patients urine and serum calcium should be monitored.
Patients with malabsorption may not take up enough vitamin D3.
Other ingredients This medicinal product contains lactose and sucrose.
Patients with rare hereditary fructose intolerance, galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
Alendronate foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.
Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Other clinically relevant interactions with medicines are not expected.
In clinical trials, several patients received estrogen (intravaginal, transdermal or oral) together with alendronate.
Adverse reactions resulting from this combined application were not observed.
Although specific interaction studies have not been conducted, alendronate has been used in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without any clinically relevant interactions.
cholestyramine, colestipol) can impair the absorption of vitamin D.
Anticonvulsants, cimetidine and thiazides can increase the metabolism of vitamin D.
An additional supplement with vitamin D should be considered individually.
ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not intended for use during pregnancy or by breastfeeding women.
There are no suitable data on the use of ADROVANCE in pregnant women.
Animal studies of alendronate show no evidence of directly damaging effects on pregnancy, embryonic fetal or postnatal development.
Alendronate given to pregnant rats caused dystocia associated with hypocalcemia (see Section 5.3).
In animal studies hypercalcemia and reproductive toxicity have been demonstrated under high doses of vitamin D (see Section 5.3).
5 It is not known whether alendronate passes into breast milk.
Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites pass into breast milk.
4.7 Effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machines
No studies have been carried out on roadworthiness or the ability to operate machinery.
However, there is no information to suggest that ADROVANCE impairs the roadworthiness or the ability to operate machines.
The following adverse events were reported during clinical trials or after the market launch of alendronate.
No other adverse events were reported for ADROVANCE.
Occasionally (1<unk> 100, <unk> 1<unk> 10), occasionally (1<unk> 1,000, <unk> 1<unk> 100), rarely (1<unk> 10,000, <unk> 1<unk> 1,000), very rarely (<unk> 1<unk> 10,000).
Common: abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, esophageal ulcer *, dysphagia *, bulging abdomen, acid regurgitation. Occasional: nausea, vomiting, gastritis, esophagitis *, esophageal erosions *, melanoma. Rare: esophageal stricture *, oropharyngeal ulcerations *, perforations, ulcers and bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract (see section 4.4<unk>. * See sections 4.2 and 4.4.
Rash, pruritus, erythema. Rare: rash with photosensitivity. Very rare: severe skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Frequently: musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain.
Rare: severe musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain (see section 4.4).
Rare: symptomatic hypocalcemia, usually in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (see section 4.4).
Rare: temporary symptoms of an acute phase reaction (myalgia, discomfort and rarely fever), usually at the start of therapy.
Following reactions were reported after launch (frequency unknown):
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates; most reports are from cancer patients, but it has also been reported in osteoporosis patients.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw is usually associated with tooth extraction or a local infection (including osteomyelitis).
Cancer diagnosis, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also considered risk factors (see section 4.4).
In clinical trials, asymptomatic, mild and temporary decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18% and 10% of patients taking alendronate 10 mg / day, respectively, compared to approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo.
However, decreases in serum calcium to 8.0 mgdl (2.0 mmoldl) and serum phosphate to 2.0 mgdl (0.65 mmoldl) occurred with similar frequency in both treatment groups.
Alendronate Oral overdose may cause hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and side effects in the upper gastrointestinal tract such as upset stomach, heartburn, esophagitis, gastritis or ulcers.
There is no specific experience of treating an overdose with alendronate.
In case of an overdose with ADROVANCE, milk or antacids should be given to bind alendronate.
Due to the risk of oesophageal irritation, no measures should be taken for vomiting and the patient should be completely upright.
Colecalciferol In long-term treatment of generally healthy adults, no vitamin D toxicity was documented for doses of less than 10,000 I.E.D. A clinical trial in healthy adults found a daily dose of 4,000 I.E.
Vitamin D3 not associated with hypercalciuria or hypercalcemia for up to 5 months.
ADROVANCE is a combination tablet with the two medicinal ingredients sodium alendronate 3 H2O and colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Alendronate Sodium alendronate 3 H2O is a bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts without having a direct effect on bone formation.
Preclinical studies showed that alendronate is preferred at the sites of active absorption
7. The activity of the osteoclasts is inhibited, but recruitment and attachment of the osteoclasts are not affected.
The bone formed under alendronate therapy is of normal quality.
Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3.
In case of insufficient sun exposure, it is essential that vitamin D3 is a component of the diet.
Vitamin D3 is converted in the liver to 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 and stored until it is needed.
The conversion to the active calcium mobilizing hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) in the kidney is strictly regulated.
The main effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate as well as to regulate serum calcium, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.
Vitamin D3 is needed for normal bone formation.
Vitamin D deficiency occurs when exposure to sunlight and intake from food are insufficient.
Deficiency is associated with a negative calcium balance, bone loss and an increased risk of skeletal fractures.
In severe cases, deficiency can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphatemia, weakness of the proximal muscles and osteomalacia, and thus to a further increased risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic individuals.
Supplementation with vitamin D reduces these risks and their consequences.
Bone mineral density) on the spine or hip, which is 2.5 standard deviations below the mean for a normal, young population, or regardless of bone density as a present pathological fracture.
ADROVANCE studies The effect of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronate 2,800 I.E. vitamin D3) on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15-week, multinational study of 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (average serum baseline of 25-hydroxyvitamin D: 56 nmL; 22.3 nmL; range: 22.5-225 nmL; 9-90 nmL).
Patients received ADROVANCE in lower strength (70 mg / 2,800 I.E.) (ng 350) or FOSAMAX (alendronate) 70 mg once a week (ng 332); further vitamin D supplements were prohibited.
After 15 weeks of treatment, median serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher (26%) in the ADROVANCE group (70 mgg / 2,800 I.U.) (56 ngl / 23 ngml) than in the alendronate group alone (46 ngl / 18.2 ngml).
ADROVANCE (70 mgg / 2,800 I.E.) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 37.5 nmL / 15 ngml) by 62.5% after 15 weeks compared to alendronate alone (12% vs 15 ngml).
32%).
ADROVANCE (70 mg / 2,800 I.E.) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 22.5 nmL / 9 ngml) by 92% compared to alendronate alone (1% vs. 13%).
In this study, mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in patients with vitamin D deficiency at the start of the study (25-hydroxyvitamin D 22.5 to 37.5 nmL) rose from 30 nmL (12.1 ngml) to 40 nmL (15.9 ngml) in the ADROVANCE (70 mgg) (n75) group and decreased from 30 nmL (12.0 ngml) at the start of the study to 26 nmL (10.4 ngml) in the Alendronate alone group (n70).
There were no differences between the treatment groups with regard to the mean values of serum calcium, phosphate or calcium in 24-hour urine.
Studies of alendronate The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate 70 mg (ng 519) once a week and alendronate 10 mg daily (ng 370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicenter study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.
After one year, increases above baseline BMD in the lumbar spine averaged 5.1% (95% CI:
4.8, 5.4%) in the 70 mg group once a week and 5.4% (95% CI:
5.0, 5.8%) in the 10 mg daily group.
Mean BMD increases were 2.3% and 2.9% respectively at the femoral neck and 2.9% and 3.1% at the total hip in the 70 mg weekly and 10 mg daily groups, respectively.
8 treatment groups were also comparable in BMD increases at other skeletal sites.
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in postmenopausal women were investigated in two Phase III studies of identical design (nG944) and in the Fracture Intervention Study (FIT: nG6,459).
In the Phase II studies, mean increases in BMD with alendronate were 10 mgg day versus placebo at 3 years, 8.8% at the spine, 5.9% at the femoral neck and 7.8% at the trochanter.
The BMD of the total skeleton also increased significantly.
In the group treated with alendronate, a 48% reduction was achieved compared to the placebo group (alendronate 3.2% compared to placebo 6.2%) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more vertebral fractures.
In the two-year extension of these studies, the increases in BMD of the spine and trochanter continued; the BMD of the femoral neck and the entire body was also maintained.
FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled studies in which alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily for either 1 or 2 years):
FIT 1: a three-year study of 2,027 patients with at least one pre-existing spinal compression fracture.
In this study, daily administration of alendronate reduced the incidence of at least one new vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).
In addition, a significant reduction in the incidence of hip fractures was observed (1.1% versus 2.2%; 51% reduction).
FIT 2: a four-year study of 4,432 patients with low bone mass but no pre-existing vertebral fracture.
In this study, a significant difference was observed in the incidence of hip fractures (alendronate 1.0% versus placebo 2.2%; reduction by 56%) and in the incidence of at least one vertebral fracture (2.9% vs. 5.8%; reduction by 50%) in the analysis of the subgroup of osteoporotic women (37% of the total number suffering from osteoporosis according to the above definition).
Resorption Based on an intravenous reference dose, the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nocturnal fasting and two hours before eating a standardized breakfast.
The bioavailability decreased accordingly to about 0.46% and 0.39% if alendronate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast.
In osteoporosis studies, alendronate was effective if taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.
The alendronate component of the ADROVANCE combination tablet (70 mg / 2,800 IU) and the 70 mg alendronate tablet are bioequivalent.
Bioavailability was minimal when alendronate was used with or up to two hours after a standardized breakfast.
Taking alendronate together with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by about 60 percent.
In healthy subjects, the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times a day for five days) did not lead to a clinically significant change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the average range of 20% to 44%).
9 Distribution studies on rats found that alendronate temporarily dissipates into soft tissue after intravenous administration of 1 mgg, but then quickly redistributes to the bone or is excreted with urine.
The average steady state volume of the distribution is at least 28 litres in humans, excluding bones.
Plasma concentrations after taking oral therapeutic doses of alendronate are too low for analytical detection (5 ngml).
Protein binding in human plasma is about 78 percent.
Biotransformation There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolized in animals or humans.
Excretion After intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactively labeled substance was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was found in the feces.
After intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 mlmin and the systemic clearance did not exceed 200 mlmin.
Plasma concentrations dropped by more than 95% within six hours of intravenous administration.
The human terminal half-life is estimated at over ten years, taking into account the release of alendronate from the skeleton.
In rats, alendronate is not excreted via the acidic or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and is therefore not thought to affect the excretion of other medicines through these transport systems in humans.
Resorption In healthy adult subjects (women and men), the mean area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC0-120 h) for vitamin D3 was 296.4 ng hdmL (excluding endogenous vitamin D3 levels) after nocturnal fasting and two hours before eating.
The mean maximum concentration in the serum (Cmax) of vitamin D3 was 5.9 ng ml and the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (Tmax) was 12 hours.
The bioavailability of 2,800 I.U. vitamin D3 in ADROVANCE is comparable to that of 2,800 I.U. vitamin D3 taken alone.
After absorption, vitamin D3 is absorbed into the blood as a component of chylomicrons.
Vitamin D3 is rapidly distributed, mainly to the liver, where it is metabolized into 25-hydroxy vitamin D3, the main storage form.
Smaller amounts are distributed in adipose and muscle tissues and are stored there as vitamin D3 to be later released into the circulation system.
Circulating vitamin D3 is bound to vitamin D-binding protein.
Biotransformation Vitamin D3 is rapidly hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and then metabolized in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the biologically active form.
Further hydroxylation occurs before excretion.
A small amount of vitamin D3 is glucuronized before excretion.
Excretion When radioactively labeled vitamin D3 was administered to healthy subjects, the mean excretion of radioactivity in urine was 2.4% after 48 hours, and 4.9% in feces after 4 days.
In both cases, radioactivity was excreted almost exclusively as metabolites of the starting substance.
The mean half-life of vitamin D3 in the serum is about 24 hours after an oral dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg / 2,800 IU).
Characteristics in patients Preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate that is not deposited in the bone is quickly excreted through the urine.
There was no evidence of saturation of bone absorption after long-term dosage of cumulative intravenous doses up to
Although no clinical data is available, renal elimination of alendronate is expected to be reduced in patients with impaired kidney function, as in animal studies.
Therefore, a slightly increased accumulation of alendronate in the bone is to be expected in patients with impaired kidney function (see section 4.2).
No non-clinical studies were conducted with the combination of alendronate and colecalciferol.
Alendronate Non-clinical data based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, chronic toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential do not indicate any particular risks to humans.
Studies on rats showed that the administration of alendronate to pregnant rats was associated with the occurrence of dystocia in the mothers, which was due to hypocalcemia.
In studies, high doses in rats caused an increased incidence of incomplete ossification in the fetus.
The significance of this observation for humans is not known.
Colecalciferol In animal studies, reproductive toxic effects were observed at doses far higher than the therapeutic dose in humans.

Rectangular, white to broken white tablets, marked with the outline of a bone on one side and 270 on the other.
Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in patients at risk of vitamin D deficiency who do not receive additional vitamin D supplementation.
ADROVANCE reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.
The recommended dosage is one ADROVANCE tablet once a week.
In view of the course of osteoporosis ADROVANCE is intended for long-term therapy.
Notes to ensure adequate absorption of alendronate:
ADROVANCE should only be taken with water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, drink or intake of medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.
Other beverages (including mineral water), foodstuffs and some medicinal products may affect the absorption of alendronate (see Section 4.5).
The following advice should be followed closely to reduce the risk of oesophageal irritation and associated side effects (see Section 4.4):
ADROVANCE should only be swallowed with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after waking up. Patients should not chew the tablet or let the tablet melt in their mouth as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcers. Patients should not lie down before the first food intake of the day, which should not be taken before 30 minutes after taking the tablet.
13 Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking ADROVANCE. ADROVANCE should not be taken before bedtime or before getting up for the first time of the day.
Patients should be supplemented with calcium if the food supply is not sufficient (see section 4.4).
The equivalent of taking 5,600 IU
Vitamin D3 once a week in ADROVANCE and 800 I.U.
Vitamin D once a day has not been studied.
In clinical trials, there was no age-related difference in the efficacy or safety profile of alendronate.
Therefore, a dose adjustment is not necessary in older people.
In patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 35 mL / min, dose adjustment is not required.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for patients with impaired kidney function with a GFR below 35 mL / min due to lack of experience.
ADROVANCE has not been studied in children and adolescents and should therefore not be used in them.
Hypersensitivity to any of the medicinal ingredients or other ingredients. Esophagus disorders and other factors that delay esophageal emptying, such as strictures or achalasia. Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes. Hypocalcemia.
Alendronate Alendronate can cause local irritation of the mucous membranes of the upper gastrointestinal tract.
Due to the possible worsening of the underlying disease, alendronate should only be given under special caution in patients with active gastrointestinal diseases, such as dysphagia, esophageal disorders, gastritis, duodenitis, ulcers, or with recent (within the last year), severe gastrointestinal disorders, such as peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding, or surgical interventions in the upper gastrointestinal tract other than pyloroplasty (see Section 4.3).
Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal strictures, were reported in patients taking alendronate (sometimes severe and requiring hospitalization).
The physician should therefore pay close attention to all signs and symptoms indicating possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be advised to discontinue the medicine and seek medical advice in the event of symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain when swallowing or retrostellar pain or new or worsening heartburn (see Section 4.8).
The risk of serious esophageal side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the drug correctly or continue to take it after symptoms appear that indicate esophageal irritation.
It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient
14 (see section 4.2). Patients should be informed that the risk of esophageal problems may be increased if they do not follow these instructions.
While no increased risk was found in large-scale clinical trials of alendronate, stomach ulcers and duodenal ulcers, some severe and with complications, were rarely reported (see Section 4.8).
Osteonecrosis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction or local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose regimen of treatment predominantly includes intravenous bisphosphonates.
Many of these patients also received chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw was also reported in osteoporosis patients taking oral bisphosphonates.
A dental examination with appropriate preventive measures should be preceded by treatment with bisphosphonates if patients have appropriate risk factors (e.g. cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, periodontitis).
During the treatment, these patients should avoid orthodontic surgery as far as possible.
If patients develop osteonecrosis of the jaw during bisphosphonate therapy, orthodontic surgery can lead to deterioration.
There are no data available to indicate whether stopping bisphosphonate therapy in patients requiring maxillofacial surgery reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
The clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient on the basis of an individual benefit-risk assessment.
Bone, joint and muscle pain were reported in patients taking bisphosphonates.
After market introduction, these symptoms were rarely severe or associated with impairment of mobility (see Section 4.8).
The time of onset of these symptoms varied from one day to several months after the start of therapy.
In most patients, the symptoms decreased after discontinuing the therapy.
In some patients, symptoms recurred when therapy with the same drug or another bisphosphonate was resumed.
Patients should be instructed that if they fail to take a dose of ADROVANCE, they should take the tablet the next morning after noticing their failure.
You should not take two tablets on the same day, but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the designated weekday.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for patients with renal insufficiency with a GFR below 35 mL / min (see section 4.2).
Other possible causes of osteoporosis besides estrogen deficiency and age should be considered.
An existing hypocalcemia must be balanced before ADROVANCE therapy can be started (see section 4.3).
Other diseases that impair the mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with ADROVANCE.
The vitamin D content of ADROVANCE is not suitable for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency.
Patients with these diseases should have serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia monitored under ADROVANCE therapy.
Due to the stimulation of bone mineralization by alendronate, decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur.
However, cases of symptomatic hypocalcemia have rarely been reported, some as severe as 15, which often occurred in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (e.g. hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption) (see Section 4.8).
Colecalciferol vitamin D3 may exacerbate the extent of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria when given to patients with diseases associated with uncontrolled overproduction of calcitriol (e.g. leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoidosis).
In these patients urine and serum calcium should be monitored.
Patients with malabsorption may not take up enough vitamin D3.
Other ingredients This medicinal product contains lactose and sucrose.
Patients with rare hereditary fructose intolerance, galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
Alendronate foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.
Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Other clinically relevant interactions with medicines are not expected.
In clinical trials, several patients received estrogen (intravaginal, transdermal or oral) together with alendronate.
Adverse reactions resulting from this combined application were not observed.
Although specific interaction studies have not been conducted, alendronate has been used in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without any clinically relevant interactions.
cholestyramine, colestipol) can impair the absorption of vitamin D.
Anticonvulsants, cimetidine and thiazides can increase the metabolism of vitamin D.
An additional supplement with vitamin D should be considered individually.
ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not intended for use during pregnancy or by breastfeeding women.
There are no suitable data on the use of ADROVANCE in pregnant women.
Animal studies of alendronate show no evidence of directly damaging effects on pregnancy, embryonic fetal or postnatal development.
Alendronate given to pregnant rats caused dystocia associated with hypocalcemia (see Section 5.3).
In animal studies hypercalcemia and reproductive toxicity have been demonstrated under high doses of vitamin D (see Section 5.3).
It is not known whether alendronate passes into breast milk.
Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites pass into breast milk.
16 4.7 Effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machinery
No studies have been carried out on roadworthiness or the ability to operate machinery.
However, there is no information to suggest that ADROVANCE impairs the roadworthiness or the ability to operate machines.
The following adverse events were reported during clinical trials or after the market launch of alendronate.
No other adverse events were reported for ADROVANCE.
Occasionally (1<unk> 100, <unk> 1<unk> 10), occasionally (1<unk> 1,000, <unk> 1<unk> 100), rarely (1<unk> 10,000, <unk> 1<unk> 1,000), very rarely (<unk> 1<unk> 10,000).
Common: abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, esophageal ulcer *, dysphagia *, bulging abdomen, acid regurgitation. Occasional: nausea, vomiting, gastritis, esophagitis *, esophageal erosions *, melanoma. Rare: esophageal stricture *, oropharyngeal ulcerations *, perforations, ulcers and bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract (see section 4.4<unk>. * See sections 4.2 and 4.4.
Rash, pruritus, erythema. Rare: rash with photosensitivity. Very rare: severe skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Frequently: musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain.
Rare: severe musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain (see section 4.4).
Rare: symptomatic hypocalcemia, usually in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (see section 4.4).
Rare: temporary symptoms of an acute phase reaction (myalgia, discomfort and rarely fever), usually at the start of therapy.
Following reactions were reported after launch (frequency unknown):
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates; most reports are from cancer patients, but it has also been reported in osteoporosis patients.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw is usually associated with tooth extraction or a local infection (including osteomyelitis).
Cancer diagnosis, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also considered risk factors (see section 4.4).
In clinical trials, asymptomatic, mild and temporary decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18% and 10% of patients taking alendronate 10 mg / day, respectively, compared to approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo.
However, decreases in serum calcium to 8.0 mgdl (2.0 mmoldl) and serum phosphate to 2.0 mgdl (0.65 mmoldl) occurred with similar frequency in both treatment groups.
Alendronate Oral overdose may cause hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and side effects in the upper gastrointestinal tract such as upset stomach, heartburn, esophagitis, gastritis or ulcers.
There is no specific experience of treating an overdose with alendronate.
In case of an overdose with ADROVANCE, milk or antacids should be given to bind alendronate.
Due to the risk of oesophageal irritation, no measures should be taken for vomiting and the patient should be completely upright.
Colecalciferol In long-term treatment of generally healthy adults, no vitamin D toxicity was documented for doses of less than 10,000 I.E.D. A clinical trial in healthy adults found a daily dose of 4,000 I.E.
Vitamin D3 not associated with hypercalciuria or hypercalcemia for up to 5 months.
ADROVANCE is a combination tablet with the two medicinal ingredients sodium alendronate 3 H2O and colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Alendronate Sodium alendronate 3 H2O is a bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts without having a direct effect on bone formation.
Preclinical studies showed that alendronate concentrates preferentially at the sites of active absorption.
The activity of the osteoclasts is inhibited, but recruitment and bonding of the osteoclasts are not affected.
The bone formed under alendronate therapy is of normal quality.
18 Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3.
In case of insufficient sun exposure, it is essential that vitamin D3 is a component of the diet.
Vitamin D3 is converted in the liver to 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 and stored until it is needed.
The conversion to the active calcium mobilizing hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) in the kidney is strictly regulated.
The main effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate as well as to regulate serum calcium, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.
Vitamin D3 is needed for normal bone formation.
Vitamin D deficiency occurs when exposure to sunlight and intake from food are insufficient.
Deficiency is associated with a negative calcium balance, bone loss and an increased risk of skeletal fractures.
In severe cases, deficiency can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphatemia, weakness of the proximal muscles and osteomalacia, and thus to a further increased risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic individuals.
Supplementation with vitamin D reduces these risks and their consequences.
Bone mineral density) on the spine or hip, which is 2.5 standard deviations below the mean for a normal, young population, or regardless of bone density as a present pathological fracture.
ADROVANCE Trials The effect of the lower dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronate 2,800 I.E. vitamin D3) on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15-week, multinational study of 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (mean serum baseline of 25-hydroxy vitamin D: 56 nmL; 22.3 nmL; range: 22.5-225 nmL; 9-90 ngml).
Patients received ADROVANCE in lower strength (70 mgg / 2,800 I.E.) (ng 350) or FOSAMAX (alendronate) 70 mg once a week (ng 332); further vitamin D supplements were prohibited.
After 15 weeks of treatment, median serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher (26%) in the ADROVANCE group (70 mgg / 2,800 I.U.) (56 ngl / 23 ngml) than in the alendronate group alone (46 ngl / 18.2 ngml).
ADROVANCE (70 mgg / 2,800 I.E.) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 37.5 nmL / 15 ngml) by 62.5% after 15 weeks compared to alendronate alone (12% vs 15 ngml).
32%).
ADROVANCE (70 mg / 2,800 I.E.) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 22.5 nmL / 9 ngml) by 92% compared to alendronate alone (1% vs. 13%).
In this study, mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in patients with vitamin D deficiency at the start of the study (25-hydroxyvitamin D 22.5 to 37.5 nmL) rose from 30 nmL (12.1 ngml) to 40 nmL (15.9 ngml) in the ADROVANCE (70 mgg) (n75) group and decreased from 30 nmL (12.0 ngml) at the start of the study to 26 nmL (10.4 ngml) in the Alendronate alone group (n70).
There were no differences between the treatment groups with regard to the mean values of serum calcium, phosphate or calcium in 24-hour urine.
The effect of the lower dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronate 2,800 I.U. vitamin D3) with an additional dose of 2,800 I.U. vitamin D3, totaling 5,600 I.U.
Vitamin D3 (equivalent to the amount of vitamin D3 in the higher dose of ADROVANCE) once a week was shown in a 24-week extension study of 619 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.
Patients in the 2,800 I.E. vitamin D3 group received ADROVANCE (70 mgv 2,800 I.E.) (ng 299) and patients in the 5,600 I.E. vitamin D3 group received ADROVANCE (70 mgv 2,800 I.E.) plus an additional 2,800 I.E. vitamin D3 (ng 309) once a week; additional vitamin D supplements were permitted; after 24 weeks of treatment, mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher in the 5,600 I.E. vitamin D3 group (69 ngv 27.6 ngv ml) than in the 2,800 I.E. vitamin D3 group (64 ngv 25.5 ngv ml).
The proportion of patients with vitamin D insufficiency during the 24-week extension study was 5.4% in the 2.800 I.E.- vitamin D3 group vs.
3.2% in the 5.600 I.E. vitamin D3 group. The proportion of patients with
19 vitamin D deficiency was 0.3% in the 2.800 I.E. vitamin D3 group vs. 0% in the 5.600 I.E. vitamin D3 group.
There were no differences between the treatment groups with regard to the mean values of serum calcium, phosphate or calcium in 24-hour urine.
There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups in the proportion of patients with hypercalciuria at the end of the 24-week extension.
Studies of alendronate The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate 70 mg (ng 519) once a week and alendronate 10 mg daily (ng 370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicenter study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.
After one year, increases above baseline BMD in the lumbar spine averaged 5.1% (95% CI:
4.8, 5.4%) in the 70 mg group once a week and 5.4% (95% CI:
5.0, 5.8%) in the 10 mg daily group.
Mean BMD increases were 2.3% and 2.9% respectively at the femoral neck and 2.9% and 3.1% at the total hip in the 70 mg weekly and 10 mg daily groups, respectively.
The two treatment groups were also comparable in BMD increases at other skeletal sites.
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in postmenopausal women were investigated in two Phase III studies of identical design (nG944) and in the Fracture Intervention Study (FIT: nG6,459).
In the Phase II studies, mean increases in BMD with alendronate were 10 mgg day versus placebo at 3 years, 8.8% at the spine, 5.9% at the femoral neck and 7.8% at the trochanter.
The BMD of the total skeleton also increased significantly.
In the group treated with alendronate, a 48% reduction was achieved compared to the placebo group (alendronate 3.2% compared to placebo 6.2%) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more vertebral fractures.
In the two-year extension of these studies, the increases in BMD of the spine and trochanter continued; the BMD of the femoral neck and the entire body was also maintained.
FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled studies in which alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily for either 1 or 2 years):
FIT 1: a three-year study of 2,027 patients with at least one pre-existing spinal compression fracture.
In this study, daily administration of alendronate reduced the incidence of at least one new vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).
In addition, a significant reduction in the incidence of hip fractures was observed (1.1% versus 2.2%; 51% reduction).
FIT 2: a four-year study of 4,432 patients with low bone mass but no pre-existing vertebral fracture.
In this study, a significant difference was observed in the incidence of hip fractures (alendronate 1.0% versus placebo 2.2%; reduction by 56%) and in the incidence of at least one vertebral fracture (2.9% vs. 5.8%; reduction by 50%) in the analysis of the subgroup of osteoporotic women (37% of the total number suffering from osteoporosis according to the above definition).
Resorption Based on an intravenous reference dose, the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nocturnal fasting and two hours before eating a standardized breakfast.
The bioavailability decreased accordingly to about 0.46% and 0.39% when alendronate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast.
20. In osteoporosis studies, alendronate was effective if taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.
The alendronate component of the ADROVANCE combination tablet (70 mgg / 5,600 I.E.) and a tablet of 70 mg alendronate are bioequivalent.
Bioavailability was minimal when alendronate was used with or up to two hours after a standardized breakfast.
Taking alendronate together with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by about 60 percent.
In healthy subjects, the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times a day for five days) did not lead to a clinically significant change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the average range of 20% to 44%).
Distribution studies on rats have shown that alendronate temporarily spreads into soft tissue after intravenous administration of 1 mgg, but then quickly redistributes to the bone or is excreted with urine.
The average steady state volume of the distribution is at least 28 litres in humans, excluding bones.
Plasma concentrations after taking oral therapeutic doses of alendronate are too low for analytical detection (5 ngml).
Protein binding in human plasma is about 78 percent.
Biotransformation There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolized in animals or humans.
Excretion After intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactively labeled substance was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was found in the feces.
After intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 mlmin and the systemic clearance did not exceed 200 mlmin.
Plasma concentrations dropped by more than 95% within six hours of intravenous administration.
The human terminal half-life is estimated at over ten years, taking into account the release of alendronate from the skeleton.
In rats, alendronate is not excreted via the acidic or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and is therefore not thought to affect the excretion of other medicines through these transport systems in humans.
Resorption In healthy adult subjects (women and men), after ADROVANCE (70 mgg / 5,600 I.U.) was administered after nocturnal fasting and two hours before eating a meal, the mean area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC0-80 h) for vitamin D3 was 490.2 ng hmL (excluding endogenous vitamin D3 levels).
The mean maximum concentration in the serum (Cmax) of vitamin D3 was 12.2 ngml and the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (Tmax) was 10.6 hours.
The bioavailability of 5.600 I.U. vitamin D3 in ADROVANCE is comparable to 5.600 I.U. vitamin D3 taken alone.
After absorption, vitamin D3 is absorbed into the blood as a component of chylomicrons.
Vitamin D3 is rapidly distributed, mainly to the liver, where it is metabolized into 25-hydroxy vitamin D3, the main storage form.
Smaller amounts are distributed in adipose and muscle tissues and are stored there as vitamin D3 to be later released into the circulation system.
Circulating vitamin D3 is bound to vitamin D-binding protein.
21 Vitamin D3 is rapidly hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 and then metabolized in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, the biologically active form.
Further hydroxylation occurs before excretion.
A small amount of vitamin D3 is glucuronized before excretion.
Excretion When radioactively labeled vitamin D3 was administered to healthy subjects, the mean excretion of radioactivity in urine was 2.4% after 48 hours, and 4.9% in feces after 4 days.
In both cases, radioactivity was excreted almost exclusively as metabolites of the starting substance.
The mean half-life of vitamin D3 in the serum is about 24 hours after an oral dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg / 2,800 IU).
Characteristics in patients Preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate that is not deposited in the bone is quickly excreted through the urine.
No evidence was found of saturation of bone absorption after long-term doses of cumulative intravenous doses of up to 35 mgg in animals.
Although no clinical data are available, it can be expected that the renal elimination of alendronate will also be reduced in patients with impaired renal function, as in animal experiments.
Therefore, a slightly increased accumulation of alendronate in the bone is to be expected in patients with impaired kidney function (see section 4.2).
No non-clinical studies were conducted with the combination of alendronate and colecalciferol.
Alendronate Non-clinical data based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, chronic toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential do not indicate any particular risks to humans.
Studies on rats showed that the administration of alendronate to pregnant rats was associated with the occurrence of dystocia in the mothers, which was due to hypocalcemia.
In studies, high doses in rats caused an increased incidence of incomplete ossification in the fetus.
The significance of this observation for humans is not known.
Colecalciferol In animal studies, reproductive toxic effects were observed at doses far higher than the therapeutic dose in humans.

Advate consists of a powder and a solvent, which are mixed to produce an injection solution.
Advate contains the active substance Octocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII).
Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the deficiency of factor VIII).
Advate is indicated for both short- and long-term use.
The medicine is only available on doctor's prescription.
Treatment with Advate should be initiated by a physician with experience in the treatment of hemophilia.
Advate is administered by injection into a vein at a rate of up to 10 ml per minute.
The dosage and frequency of use depend on whether Advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.
The dosage is also adjusted according to the severity of the bleeding and the type of surgical intervention.
Detailed explanations for the calculation of dosages can be found in the package leaflet.
The active ingredient in Advate, Octocog alfa, is a protein of the blood coagulation factor.
Factor VIII is one of the substances (factors) in the body involved in blood clotting.
Patients with haemophilia A suffer from Factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.
Advate is used to replace the missing factor VIII.
It corrects factor VIII deficiency and allows temporary control of bleeding disorder.
Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced using a method known as recombinant DNA technology:
It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) has been introduced that enables it to form the human clotting factor VIII.

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is recognised. How has Advate been examined? Advate is similar to another medicine authorised in the European Union called Recombinate, but is manufactured differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.
For this reason, Advate was compared to Recombinate in a major study of 111 patients suffering from haemophilia A to show that both medicines are equivalent. In addition, the number of bleeding episodes and the efficacy of Advate in hemostasis was evaluated on a scale from ineffective to excellent in 107 patients who received all Advate. Three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under the age of six, investigated the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and for surgery.
What benefits has Advate shown in these studies?
In the main study, Advate's effectiveness in preventing bleeding was rated excellent or good in 86% of 510 new bleeding episodes.
In addition, 81% of these bleeding episodes required only a single treatment with Advate.
Additional studies, including one involving children under the age of six, confirmed the efficacy of Advate.
Patients with hemophilia A may form antibodies (inhibitors) to Factor VIII.
An antibody is a protein produced by the body due to its natural protective mechanism in response to unknown substances.
If antibodies develop, the effectiveness of Advate is not guaranteed.
The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies to Factor VIII.
In some patients treated with drugs containing factor VIII, hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) was observed.
The full list of side effects reported in connection with Advate can be found in the package leaflet.
Advate should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Advate in the treatment and propyhlaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital deficiency of factor VIII) outweigh the risks and recommended authorisation for the placing on the market of Advate.
On 2 March 2004, the European Commission authorised Baxter AG to market Advate throughout the European Union.
The authorisation was extended on 2 March 2009.
The full text of the EPAR for Advate is available here.
Powder: Piercing bottle (glass) Solvent: Piercing bottle (glass)
1 vial + 1 vial + device for reconstitution
ADVATE 250 I.E. powders and solvents for the production of an injection solution
Each bottle contains 250 I.E.* recombinant blood clotting factor VIII (rDNA) octocog alfag *.
After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains about 50ml of Octocog alfa.
Activity is determined using a chromogenic assay against an in-house standard, which refers to the WHO standard, and the specific activity is approximately 4,000- 10,000 I.E.M. Human blood clotting factor VIII, produced using recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovarian cells (CHO).
Prepared without the addition of an (exogenous) human or animal protein during the cell culture process, purification and final formulation.
0.45 mmol sodium chloride (10 mg) per vial.
See Section 6.1 for a complete list of other components.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free of foreign particles and has a pH value of 6.7 to 7.3.
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE does not contain pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of the von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be carried out under the supervision of a doctor familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the Factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.
The Factor VIII dose is given in International Units (I.E.) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in I.E. (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
2 An I.E. of factor VIII- activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in a ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required Factor VIII dose is based on the empirical finding that 1 I.U.
Factor VIII per kg body weight increases Factor VIII activity in the plasma by 2 I.E.D.
The required dose is calculated with the following formula:
Required units (I.E.) = body weight (kg) x desired factor -VIII-increase (%) x 0.5
In the case of subsequent haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII- activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in I.E.dl) during the corresponding period.
The following table 1 indicates the dosage for bleeding and surgical procedures:
Table 1: Dosage guidance for bleeding events and operations Grade of bleeding / type of surgical intervention Bleeding
Required Factor VIII plasma level (% or I.E.D.)
Frequency of dosage (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
Early joint bleeding, muscle bleeding or bleeding in the mouth.
Repeat injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until the bleeding is indicated by pain or healing is achieved.
More pronounced joint bleeding, muscle bleeding or hematoma.
Repeat the injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for 3-4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are removed.
Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until the danger to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
Repeat injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain Factor VIII activity of 30-60% (I.E.D.).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
In certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher dosages than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
In order to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections, appropriate determination of Factor VIII- plasma levels is recommended during the course of the treatment.
Particularly in major surgical procedures, precise monitoring of substitution therapy by determining factor VIII- activity in the plasma is essential.
Individual patients may differ in their response to Factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-lives.
3 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of Factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2-3 days.
In patients under 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 I.U. Factor VIII per kg body weight 3 4 times a week is recommended.
Patients should be regularly monitored for the formation of Factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitor values it is possible that Factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in treating patients with hemophilia. See Section 4.4.
Type of application ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is required beforehand.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient's condition, with a maximum injection rate of 10 mlg / min not exceeded.
In the interest of patients, it is recommended to note the name and batch number of the product every time ADVATE is administered.
For information on the reconstitution prior to administration see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the medicinal ingredient or any of the other ingredients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, allergic hypersensitivity reactions can occur.
This product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be aware of the signs of an immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction, such as rash, itching, generalized urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e.g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory symptoms (e.g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should stop treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
In the event of an anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be carried out according to the current medical standard (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.
These inhibitors are always directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by means of modified Bethesda assay.
Patients who develop inhibitors against Factor VIII may experience an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, contact with a hemophilia center is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the risk being highest within the first 20 days of exposure and depending on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestically known inhibitor development, the recurrence of (low titre) inhibitors was observed after conversion from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors. See Section 4.8.
4 This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol of sodium (10 mg) per vial according to the reconstitution.
This must be taken into account for patients on a sodium-controlled diet.
4.5. Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
No studies have been carried out on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicines.
Animal reproduction studies were not carried out with Factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, there is no experience of the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
Therefore, Factor VIII should only be used during pregnancy and lactation if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machines
ADVATE has no effect on the mobility and the ability to operate machines.
As with any intravenous protein, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type are possible (see section 4.4).
During clinical trials with ADVATE, a total of 56 adverse events (ADRs) were reported in 27 of 234 patients treated once.
The ADRs found in the largest number of patients were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients with a higher risk of forming inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Of the total 56 adverse events, none were reported in newborns, 16 were reported in 1,332 infants, 7 in 456 children, 8 in 431 adolescents and 25 in 1,494 adults.
Frequency categories are defined according to the following criteria: Very common (1<unk> 10), Frequent (1<unk> 100 to 1<unk> 10), Occasional (1<unk> 1,000 to 1<unk> 100), Rare (1<unk> 10,000 to 1<unk> 1,000), Very rare (1<unk> 10,000), Unknown (Frequency not estimable based on available data).
Within the frequencies the side effects are listed according to decreasing severity.
The following table 2 shows the frequency of adverse events in clinical trials:

Injury, poisoning and by interventions
a) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in blood coagulation factor VIII level occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient receiving continuous ADVATE infusion.
Blood clotting was maintained throughout and both the Factor VIII levels in the plasma and the clearance rate returned to sufficient levels on day 15 postoperatively.
After the continuous infusion, tests for Factor VIII inhibitors were performed and were negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to Factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient showed low inhibitortiter after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).
Subsequent inhibitor tests on this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
Furthermore, none of the 53 pediatric patients under 6 years of age diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) were diagnosed with an FVIII inhibitor after prior exposure to Factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors against Factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 had a low titer (5 Bethesda units).
The frequency of detection of FVIII inhibitors so far is in line with expectations and in the range already observed.
The patient's immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analyzed by examining antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients had persistent peaks or temporary peaks.
One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels against antiCHO cell protein, but otherwise showed no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients had a persistent peak or a temporary peak.
One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels against murine IgG.
In four patients the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes with multiple repeated product exposures was reported in the study.
7 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE reported allergic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency unknown).
Symptoms of human overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII are not known.
Pharmacotherapeutic Group:
The factor VIII<unk> of Willebrand Factor complex consists of two proteins (Factor VIII and Willebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant blood clotting factor VIII (Octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approx. 280 kD.
When octocog alfa is injected into a haemophilia A patient, it binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor in the bloodstream.
The activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
The activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clot formation can take place.
Haemophilia A is a sex-related, hereditary blood clotting disorder caused by reduced Factor VIII levels.
This leads to severe bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
The Factor VIII- plasma levels are increased by the substitution therapy, whereby a temporary correction of the Factor VIII- deficiency and the tendency to bleed occurs.
All pharmacokinetics studies with ADVATE were conducted on previously treated patients with severe or moderate hemophilia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
The evaluation of the plasma samples took place in a central laboratory using a single-stage clotting test.
Pharmacokinetic parameters are derived from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or equal to 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below.

Recovery and measured half-life was about 20% lower in young children (below 6 years) than in adults, which may be due to the higher plasma volume per kg body weight in younger patients.
There are no pharmacokinetic data on the use of ADVATE in previously untreated patients.
Non-clinical data, based on studies on safety pharmacology, acute, recurrent and local toxicity and genotoxicity, show no specific risk to humans.

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE does not contain pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of the von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be carried out under the supervision of a doctor familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the Factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.
The Factor VIII dose is given in International Units (I.E.) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in I.E. (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
13 An I.E. of Factor VIII- activity corresponds to the amount of Factor VIII in a ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required Factor VIII dose is based on empirical evidence that 1 I.E. Factor VIII per kg body weight increases Factor VIII activity in the plasma by 2 I.E.D.
The required dose is calculated with the following formula:
Required units (I.E.) = body weight (kg) x desired factor -VIII-increase (%) x 0.5
In the case of subsequent haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII- activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in I.E.dl) during the corresponding period.
The following table 1 indicates the dosage for bleeding and surgical procedures:

Every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
Repeat injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain Factor VIII activity of 30-60% (I.E.D.).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
In certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher dosages than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
In order to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections, appropriate determination of Factor VIII- plasma levels is recommended during the course of the treatment.
Particularly in major surgical procedures, precise monitoring of substitution therapy by determining factor VIII- activity in the plasma is essential.
Individual patients may differ in their response to Factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-lives.
14 Prophylaxis For the long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of Factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2-3 days.
In patients under 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 I.U. Factor VIII per kg body weight 3 4 times a week is recommended.
Patients should be regularly monitored for the formation of Factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitor values it is possible that Factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in treating patients with hemophilia. See Section 4.4.
Type of application ADVATE should be administered intravenously.

In the interest of patients, it is recommended to note the name and batch number of the product every time ADVATE is administered.
For information on the reconstitution prior to administration see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the medicinal ingredient or any of the other ingredients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, allergic hypersensitivity reactions can occur.
This product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be aware of the signs of an immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction, such as rash, itching, generalized urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e.g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory symptoms (e.g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should stop treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
In the event of an anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be carried out according to the current medical standard (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.
These inhibitors are always directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by means of modified Bethesda assay.

In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestically known inhibitor development, the recurrence of (low titre) inhibitors was observed after conversion from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors. See Section 4.8.
15 This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol of sodium (10 mg) per vial according to the reconstitution.
This must be taken into account for patients on a sodium-controlled diet.
4.5. Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
No studies have been carried out on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicines.
Animal reproduction studies were not carried out with Factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, there is no experience of the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
Therefore, Factor VIII should only be used during pregnancy and lactation if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machines
ADVATE has no effect on the mobility and the ability to operate machines.
As with any intravenous protein, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type are possible (see section 4.4).
During clinical trials with ADVATE, a total of 56 adverse events (ADRs) were reported in 27 of 234 patients treated once.
The ADRs found in the largest number of patients were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients with a higher risk of forming inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Of the total 56 adverse events, none were reported in newborns, 16 were reported in 1,332 infants, 7 in 456 children, 8 in 431 adolescents and 25 in 1,494 adults.
Frequency categories are defined according to the following criteria: Very common (1<unk> 10), Frequent (1<unk> 100 to 1<unk> 10), Occasional (1<unk> 1,000 to 1<unk> 100), Rare (1<unk> 10,000 to 1<unk> 1,000), Very rare (1<unk> 10,000), Unknown (Frequency not estimable based on available data).

After the continuous infusion, tests for Factor VIII inhibitors were performed and were negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 children and adults 4 with diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to Factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient showed low inhibitortiter after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).
Subsequent inhibitor tests on this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
Furthermore, none of the 53 pediatric patients under 6 years of age diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) were diagnosed with an FVIII inhibitor after prior exposure to Factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors against Factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 had a low titer (5 Bethesda units).
The frequency of detection of FVIII inhibitors so far is in line with expectations and in the range already observed.
The patient's immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analyzed by examining antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients had persistent peaks or temporary peaks.
One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels against antiCHO cell protein, but otherwise showed no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients had a persistent peak or a temporary peak.
One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels against murine IgG.
In four patients the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes with multiple repeated product exposures was reported in the study.
18 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE reported allergic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency unknown).
Symptoms of human overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII are not known.
Pharmacotherapeutic Group:
The factor VIII<unk> of Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions.
ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approx. 280 kD.
When octocog alfa is injected into a haemophilia A patient, it binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor in the bloodstream.
The activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
The activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clot formation can take place.
Haemophilia A is a sex-related, hereditary blood clotting disorder caused by reduced Factor VIII levels.
This leads to severe bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
The Factor VIII- plasma levels are increased by the substitution therapy, whereby a temporary correction of the Factor VIII- deficiency and the tendency to bleed occurs.
All pharmacokinetics studies with ADVATE were conducted on previously treated patients with severe or moderate hemophilia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
The evaluation of the plasma samples took place in a central laboratory using a single-stage clotting test.
Pharmacokinetic parameters are derived from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or equal to 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below.

Recovery and measured half-life was about 20% lower in young children (below 6 years) than in adults, which may be due to the higher plasma volume per kg body weight in younger patients.
There are no pharmacokinetic data on the use of ADVATE in previously untreated patients.
Non-clinical data, based on studies on safety pharmacology, acute, recurrent and local toxicity and genotoxicity, show no specific risk to humans.

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) website https: / / www.emea.europa.eu /.
ADVATE 1000 I.E. powders and solvents for the production of an injection solution
Each bottle contains a nominal 1000 I.E.* recombinant blood clotting factor VIII (rDNA) octocog alfag *.
After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains about 200 I.E.D. ml of Octocog alfa.
Activity is determined using a chromogenic assay against an in-house standard, which refers to the WHO standard, and the specific activity is approximately 4,000- 10,000 I.E.M. Human blood clotting factor VIII, produced using recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovarian cells (CHO).
Prepared without the addition of an (exogenous) human or animal protein during the cell culture process, purification and final formulation.
0.45 mmol sodium chloride (10 mg) per vial.
See Section 6.1 for a complete list of other components.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free of foreign particles and has a pH value of 6.7 to 7.3.
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE does not contain pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of the von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be carried out under the supervision of a doctor familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the Factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.
The Factor VIII dose is given in International Units (I.E.) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in I.E. (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
24 I.E. factor VIII- activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in a ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required Factor VIII dose is based on empirical evidence that 1 I.E. Factor VIII per kg body weight increases Factor VIII activity in the plasma by 2 I.E.D.
The required dose is calculated with the following formula:
Required units (I.E.) = body weight (kg) x desired factor -VIII-increase (%) x 0.5
In the case of subsequent haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII- activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in I.E.dl) during the corresponding period.
The following table 1 indicates the dosage for bleeding and surgical procedures:
Table 1: Dosage guidance for bleeding events and operations Grade of bleeding / type of surgical intervention Bleeding
Required Factor VIII plasma level (% or I.E.D.)
Frequency of dosage (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
Early joint bleeding, muscle bleeding or bleeding in the mouth.
Repeat injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until the bleeding is indicated by pain or healing is achieved.
More pronounced joint bleeding, muscle bleeding or hematoma.
Repeat the injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for 3-4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are removed.
Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until the danger to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
Repeat injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain Factor VIII activity of 30-60% (I.E.D.).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
In certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher dosages than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
In order to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections, appropriate determination of Factor VIII- plasma levels is recommended during the course of the treatment.
Particularly in major surgical procedures, precise monitoring of substitution therapy by determining factor VIII- activity in the plasma is essential.
Individual patients may differ in their response to Factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-lives.
25 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of Factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2-3 days.
In patients under 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 I.U. Factor VIII per kg body weight 3 4 times a week is recommended.
Patients should be regularly monitored for the formation of Factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitor values it is possible that Factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in treating patients with hemophilia. See Section 4.4.
Type of application ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is required beforehand.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient's condition, with a maximum injection rate of 10 mlg / min not exceeded.
In the interest of patients, it is recommended to note the name and batch number of the product every time ADVATE is administered.
For information on the reconstitution prior to administration see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the medicinal ingredient or any of the other ingredients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, allergic hypersensitivity reactions can occur.
This product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be aware of the signs of an immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction, such as rash, itching, generalized urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e.g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory symptoms (e.g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should stop treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
In the event of an anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be carried out according to the current medical standard (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.
These inhibitors are always directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by means of modified Bethesda assay.
Patients who develop inhibitors against Factor VIII may experience an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, contact with a hemophilia center is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the risk being highest within the first 20 days of exposure and depending on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestically known inhibitor development, the recurrence of (low titre) inhibitors was observed after conversion from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors. See Section 4.8.
26 This medicine contains 0.45 mmol of sodium (10 mg) per vial according to the reconstitution.
This must be taken into account for patients on a sodium-controlled diet.
4.5. Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
No studies have been carried out on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicines.
Animal reproduction studies were not carried out with Factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, there is no experience of the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
Therefore, Factor VIII should only be used during pregnancy and lactation if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machines
ADVATE has no effect on the mobility and the ability to operate machines.
As with any intravenous protein, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type are possible (see section 4.4).
During clinical trials with ADVATE, a total of 56 adverse events (ADRs) were reported in 27 of 234 patients treated once.
The ADRs found in the largest number of patients were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients with a higher risk of forming inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Of the total 56 adverse events, none were observed in newborns, 16 were reported in 1,332 infants, 7 in 456 children, 8 in 431 adolescents and 25 in 1,494 adults.
Frequency categories are defined according to the following criteria: Very common (1<unk> 10), Frequent (1<unk> 100 to 1<unk> 10), Occasional (1<unk> 1,000 to 1<unk> 100), Rare (1<unk> 10,000 to 1<unk> 1,000), Very rare (1<unk> 10,000), Unknown (Frequency not estimable based on available data).
Within the frequencies the side effects are listed according to decreasing severity.
The following table 2 shows the frequency of adverse events in clinical trials:

a) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in blood coagulation factor VIII level occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient receiving continuous ADVATE infusion.
Blood clotting was maintained throughout and both the Factor VIII levels in the plasma and the clearance rate returned to sufficient levels on day 15 postoperatively.
After the continuous infusion, tests for Factor VIII inhibitors were performed and were negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 children and adults 6 with diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to Factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient showed low inhibitortiter after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).
Subsequent inhibitor tests on this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
Furthermore, none of the 53 pediatric patients under 6 years of age diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) were diagnosed with an FVIII inhibitor after prior exposure to Factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors against Factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 had a low titer (5 Bethesda units).
The frequency of detection of FVIII inhibitors so far is in line with expectations and in the range already observed.
The patient's immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analyzed by examining antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients had persistent peaks or temporary peaks.
One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels against antiCHO cell protein, but otherwise showed no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients had a persistent peak or a temporary peak.
One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels against murine IgG.
In four patients the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes with multiple repeated product exposures was reported in the study.
29 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE reported allergic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency unknown).
Symptoms of human overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII are not known.

Every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
Repeat injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain Factor VIII activity of 30-60% (I.E.D.).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
In certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher dosages than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.

Particularly in major surgical procedures, precise monitoring of substitution therapy by determining factor VIII- activity in the plasma is essential.
Individual patients may differ in their response to Factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-lives.
36 Prophylaxis For the long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of Factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2-3 days.
In patients under 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 I.U. Factor VIII per kg body weight 3 4 times a week is recommended.
Patients should be regularly monitored for the formation of Factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitor values it is possible that Factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in treating patients with hemophilia. See Section 4.4.
Type of application ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is required beforehand.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient's condition, with a maximum injection rate of 10 mlg / min not exceeded.
In the interest of patients, it is recommended to note the name and batch number of the product every time ADVATE is administered.
For information on the reconstitution prior to administration see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the medicinal ingredient or any of the other ingredients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, allergic hypersensitivity reactions can occur.
This product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be aware of the signs of an immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction, such as rash, itching, generalized urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e.g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory symptoms (e.g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should stop treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
In the event of an anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be carried out according to the current medical standard (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.
These inhibitors are always directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by means of modified Bethesda assay.
Patients who develop inhibitors against Factor VIII may experience an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, contact with a hemophilia center is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the risk being highest within the first 20 days of exposure and depending on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestically known inhibitor development, the recurrence of (low titre) inhibitors was observed after conversion from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors. See Section 4.8.
37 This medicine contains 0.45 mmol of sodium (10 mg) per vial according to the reconstitution.
This must be taken into account for patients on a sodium-controlled diet.
4.5. Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
No studies have been carried out on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicines.
Animal reproduction studies were not carried out with Factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, there is no experience of the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
Therefore, Factor VIII should only be used during pregnancy and lactation if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machines
ADVATE has no effect on the mobility and the ability to operate machines.
As with any intravenous protein, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type are possible (see section 4.4).
During clinical trials with ADVATE, a total of 56 adverse events (ADRs) were reported in 27 of 234 patients treated once.
The ADRs found in the largest number of patients were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients with a higher risk of forming inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Of the total 56 adverse events, none were observed in newborns, 16 were reported in 1,332 infants, 7 in 456 children, 8 in 431 adolescents and 25 in 1,494 adults.
Frequency categories are defined according to the following criteria: Very common (1<unk> 10), Frequent (1<unk> 100 to 1<unk> 10), Occasional (1<unk> 1,000 to 1<unk> 100), Rare (1<unk> 10,000 to 1<unk> 1,000), Very rare (1<unk> 10,000), Unknown (Frequency not estimable based on available data).
Within the frequencies the side effects are listed according to decreasing severity.
The following table 2 shows the frequency of adverse events in clinical trials:

a) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in blood coagulation factor VIII level occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient receiving continuous ADVATE infusion.
Blood clotting was maintained throughout and both the Factor VIII levels in the plasma and the clearance rate returned to sufficient levels on day 15 postoperatively.
After the continuous infusion, tests for Factor VIII inhibitors were performed and were negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 children and adults, 8 with diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and prior exposure to Factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient showed low inhibitortiter after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).
Subsequent inhibitor tests on this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
Furthermore, none of the 53 pediatric patients under 6 years of age diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) were diagnosed with an FVIII inhibitor after prior exposure to Factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors against Factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 had a low titer (5 Bethesda units).
The frequency of detection of FVIII inhibitors so far is in line with expectations and in the range already observed.
The patient's immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analyzed by examining antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients had persistent peaks or temporary peaks.
One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels against antiCHO cell protein, but otherwise showed no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients had a persistent peak or a temporary peak.
One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels against murine IgG.
In four patients the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes with multiple repeated product exposures was reported in the study.
40 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE reported allergic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency unknown).
Symptoms of human overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII are not known.
Pharmacotherapeutic Group:
The factor VIII<unk> of Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions.
ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approx. 280 kD.
When octocog alfa is injected into a haemophilia A patient, it binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor in the bloodstream.
The activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
The activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clot formation can take place.
Haemophilia A is a sex-related, hereditary blood clotting disorder caused by reduced Factor VIII levels.
This leads to severe bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
The Factor VIII- plasma levels are increased by the substitution therapy, whereby a temporary correction of the Factor VIII- deficiency and the tendency to bleed occurs.
All pharmacokinetics studies with ADVATE were conducted on previously treated patients with severe or moderate hemophilia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
The evaluation of the plasma samples took place in a central laboratory using a single-stage clotting test.
Pharmacokinetic parameters are derived from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or equal to 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below.

Recovery and measured half-life was about 20% lower in young children (below 6 years) than in adults, which may be due to the higher plasma volume per kg body weight in younger patients.
There are no pharmacokinetic data on the use of ADVATE in previously untreated patients.
Non-clinical data, based on studies on safety pharmacology, acute, recurrent and local toxicity and genotoxicity, show no specific risk to humans.

ADVATE 2000 I.E. powders and solvents for the production of an injection solution
Each bottle contains 2000 I.E.* recombinant blood clotting factor VIII (rDNA) octocog alfag *.
After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains about 400 I.E.M. of Octocog alfa.
Activity is determined using a chromogenic assay against an in-house standard, which refers to the WHO standard, and the specific activity is approximately 4,000- 10,000 I.E.M. Human blood clotting factor VIII, produced using recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovarian cells (CHO).
Prepared without the addition of an (exogenous) human or animal protein during the cell culture process, purification and final formulation.
0.45 mmol sodium chloride (10 mg) per vial.
See Section 6.1 for a complete list of other components.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free of foreign particles and has a pH value of 6.7 to 7.3.
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE does not contain pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of the von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be carried out under the supervision of a doctor familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the Factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.
The Factor VIII dose is given in International Units (I.E.) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in I.E. (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
46 An I.E. of Factor VIII- activity corresponds to the amount of Factor VIII in a ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required Factor VIII dose is based on empirical evidence that 1 I.E. Factor VIII per kg body weight increases Factor VIII activity in the plasma by 2 I.E.D.
The required dose is calculated with the following formula:
Required units (I.E.) = body weight (kg) x desired factor -VIII-increase (%) x 0.5
In the case of subsequent haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII- activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in I.E.dl) during the corresponding period.
The following table 1 indicates the dosage for bleeding and surgical procedures:
Table 1: Dosage guidance for bleeding events and operations Grade of bleeding / type of surgical intervention Bleeding
Required Factor VIII plasma level (% or I.E.D.)
Frequency of dosage (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
Early joint bleeding, muscle bleeding or bleeding in the mouth.
Repeat injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until the bleeding is indicated by pain or healing is achieved.
More pronounced joint bleeding, muscle bleeding or hematoma.
Repeat the injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for 3-4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are removed.
Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until the danger to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
Repeat injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain Factor VIII activity of 30-60% (I.E.D.).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
In certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher dosages than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
In order to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections, appropriate determination of Factor VIII- plasma levels is recommended during the course of the treatment.
Particularly in major surgical procedures, precise monitoring of substitution therapy by determining factor VIII- activity in the plasma is essential.
Individual patients may differ in their response to Factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-lives.
47 Prophylaxis For the long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of Factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2-3 days.
In patients under 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 I.U. Factor VIII per kg body weight 3 4 times a week is recommended.
Patients should be regularly monitored for the formation of Factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitor values it is possible that Factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in treating patients with hemophilia. See Section 4.4.
Type of application ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is required beforehand.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient's condition, with a maximum injection rate of 10 mlg / min not exceeded.
In the interest of patients, it is recommended to note the name and batch number of the product every time ADVATE is administered.
For information on the reconstitution prior to administration see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the medicinal ingredient or any of the other ingredients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, allergic hypersensitivity reactions can occur.
This product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be aware of the signs of an immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction, such as rash, itching, generalized urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e.g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory symptoms (e.g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should stop treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
In the event of an anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be carried out according to the current medical standard (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.
These inhibitors are always directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by means of modified Bethesda assay.
Patients who develop inhibitors against Factor VIII may experience an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, contact with a hemophilia center is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the risk being highest within the first 20 days of exposure and depending on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestically known inhibitor development, the recurrence of (low titre) inhibitors was observed after conversion from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors. See Section 4.8.
48 This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol of sodium (10 mg) per vial according to the reconstitution.
This must be taken into account for patients on a sodium-controlled diet.
4.5. Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
No studies have been carried out on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicines.
Animal reproduction studies were not carried out with Factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, there is no experience of the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
Therefore, Factor VIII should only be used during pregnancy and lactation if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machines
ADVATE has no effect on the mobility and the ability to operate machines.
As with any intravenous protein, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type are possible (see section 4.4).

Blood clotting was maintained throughout and both the Factor VIII levels in the plasma and the clearance rate returned to sufficient levels on day 15 postoperatively.
After the continuous infusion, tests for Factor VIII inhibitors were performed and were negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 children and adults, 10 with diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and prior exposure to Factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient showed low inhibitortiter after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).
Subsequent inhibitor tests on this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
Furthermore, none of the 53 pediatric patients under 6 years of age diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) were diagnosed with an FVIII inhibitor after prior exposure to Factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors against Factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 had a low titer (5 Bethesda units).
The frequency of detection of FVIII inhibitors so far is in line with expectations and in the range already observed.
The patient's immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analyzed by examining antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients had persistent peaks or temporary peaks.
One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels against antiCHO cell protein, but otherwise showed no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients had a persistent peak or a temporary peak.
One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels against murine IgG.
In four patients the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes with multiple repeated product exposures was reported in the study.
51 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE reported allergic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency unknown).
Symptoms of human overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII are not known.

Activity is determined using a chromogenic assay against an in-house standard, which refers to the WHO standard, and the specific activity is approximately 4,000- 10,000 I.E.M. Human blood clotting factor VIII, produced using recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovarian cells (CHO).
Prepared without the addition of an (exogenous) human or animal protein during the cell culture process, purification and final formulation.
0.45 mmol sodium chloride (10 mg) per vial.
See Section 6.1 for a complete list of other components.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free of foreign particles and has a pH value of 6.7 to 7.3.
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE does not contain pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of the von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be carried out under the supervision of a doctor familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the Factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.
The Factor VIII dose is given in International Units (I.E.) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in I.E. (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
57 I.E. factor VIII- activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in a ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required Factor VIII dose is based on empirical evidence that 1 I.E. Factor VIII per kg body weight increases Factor VIII activity in the plasma by 2 I.E.D.
The required dose is calculated with the following formula:
Required units (I.E.) = body weight (kg) x desired factor -VIII-increase (%) x 0.5
In the case of subsequent haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII- activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in I.E.dl) during the corresponding period.
The following table 1 indicates the dosage for bleeding and surgical procedures:
Table 1: Dosage guidance for bleeding events and operations Grade of bleeding / type of surgical intervention Bleeding
Required Factor VIII plasma level (% or I.E.D.)
Frequency of dosage (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
Early joint bleeding, muscle bleeding or bleeding in the mouth.
Repeat injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until the bleeding is indicated by pain or healing is achieved.
More pronounced joint bleeding, muscle bleeding or hematoma.
Repeat the injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for 3-4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are removed.
Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until the danger to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
Repeat injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain Factor VIII activity of 30-60% (I.E.D.).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the clinical efficacy of the product in individual cases.
In certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher dosages than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
In order to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections, appropriate determination of Factor VIII- plasma levels is recommended during the course of the treatment.
Particularly in major surgical procedures, precise monitoring of substitution therapy by determining factor VIII- activity in the plasma is essential.
Individual patients may differ in their response to Factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-lives.
58 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of Factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2-3 days.
In patients under 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 I.U. Factor VIII per kg body weight 3 4 times a week is recommended.
Patients should be regularly monitored for the formation of Factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitor values it is possible that Factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in treating patients with hemophilia. See Section 4.4.
Type of application ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is required beforehand.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient's condition, with a maximum injection rate of 10 mlg / min not exceeded.
In the interest of patients, it is recommended to note the name and batch number of the product every time ADVATE is administered.
For information on the reconstitution prior to administration see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the medicinal ingredient or any of the other ingredients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, allergic hypersensitivity reactions can occur.
This product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be aware of the signs of an immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction, such as rash, itching, generalized urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e.g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory symptoms (e.g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should stop treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
In the event of an anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be carried out according to the current medical standard (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.
These inhibitors are always directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by means of modified Bethesda assay.
Patients who develop inhibitors against Factor VIII may experience an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, contact with a hemophilia center is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the risk being highest within the first 20 days of exposure and depending on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestically known inhibitor development, the recurrence of (low titre) inhibitors was observed after conversion from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors. See Section 4.8.
59 This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol of sodium (10 mg) per vial according to the reconstitution.
This must be taken into account for patients on a sodium-controlled diet.
4.5. Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
No studies have been carried out on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicines.
Animal reproduction studies were not carried out with Factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, there is no experience of the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.
Therefore, Factor VIII should only be used during pregnancy and lactation if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machines
ADVATE has no effect on the mobility and the ability to operate machines.
As with any intravenous protein, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type are possible (see section 4.4).
During clinical trials with ADVATE, a total of 56 adverse events (ADRs) were reported in 27 of 234 patients treated once.
The ADRs found in the largest number of patients were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients with a higher risk of forming inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Of the total 56 adverse events, none were observed in newborns, 16 were reported in 1,332 infants, 7 in 456 children, 8 in 431 adolescents and 25 in 1,494 adults.
Frequency categories are defined according to the following criteria: Very common (1<unk> 10), Frequent (1<unk> 100 to 1<unk> 10), Occasional (1<unk> 1,000 to 1<unk> 100), Rare (1<unk> 10,000 to 1<unk> 1,000), Very rare (1<unk> 10,000), Unknown (Frequency not estimable based on available data).
Within the frequencies the side effects are listed according to decreasing severity.
The following table 2 shows the frequency of adverse events in clinical trials:

a) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in blood coagulation factor VIII level occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient receiving continuous ADVATE infusion.
Blood clotting was maintained throughout and both the Factor VIII levels in the plasma and the clearance rate returned to sufficient levels on day 15 postoperatively.
After the continuous infusion, tests for Factor VIII inhibitors were performed and were negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials with ADVATE on 145 children and adults, 12 with diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and prior exposure to Factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient showed low inhibitortiter after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).
Subsequent inhibitor tests on this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
Furthermore, none of the 53 pediatric patients under 6 years of age diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) were diagnosed with an FVIII inhibitor after prior exposure to Factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors against Factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 had a low titer (5 Bethesda units).
The frequency of detection of FVIII inhibitors so far is in line with expectations and in the range already observed.
The patient's immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analyzed by examining antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients had persistent peaks or temporary peaks.
One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels against antiCHO cell protein, but otherwise showed no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients had a persistent peak or a temporary peak.
One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak in antibody levels against murine IgG.
In four patients the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes with multiple repeated product exposures was reported in the study.
62 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE reported allergic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency unknown).
Symptoms of human overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII are not known.
Pharmacotherapeutic Group:
The factor VIII<unk> of Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions.
ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approx. 280 kD.
When octocog alfa is injected into a haemophilia A patient, it binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor in the bloodstream.
The activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
The activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clot formation can take place.
Haemophilia A is a sex-related, hereditary blood clotting disorder caused by reduced Factor VIII levels.
This leads to severe bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
The Factor VIII- plasma levels are increased by the substitution therapy, whereby a temporary correction of the Factor VIII- deficiency and the tendency to bleed occurs.
All pharmacokinetics studies with ADVATE were conducted on previously treated patients with severe or moderate hemophilia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
The evaluation of the plasma samples took place in a central laboratory using a single-stage clotting test.
Pharmacokinetic parameters are derived from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or equal to 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below.

Recovery and measured half-life was about 20% lower in young children (below 6 years) than in adults, which may be due to the higher plasma volume per kg body weight in younger patients.
There are no pharmacokinetic data on the use of ADVATE in previously untreated patients.
Non-clinical data, based on studies on safety pharmacology, acute, recurrent and local toxicity and genotoxicity, show no specific risk to humans.

Read the entire leaflet carefully before starting to use this medicine.
- If you have any further questions, consult your doctor.
- This medicine has been prescribed to you.
It may not be passed on to third parties.
It can hurt other people, even if they have the same complaints as you.
- If any of the listed side effects significantly impairs you or you
If you notice any side effects that are not specified in this information, please inform your doctor.
What is ADVATE and what is it used for?
2. What do you need to consider before using ADVATE? 3. How to use ADVATE?
WHAT IS ADVATE AND WHERE IS IT APPLICATED TO?
As a medicinal ingredient, ADVATE contains octocog alfa, human coagulation factor VIII, produced using recombinant DNA technology.
Factor VIII is necessary to form clots in the blood to stop bleeding.
In patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) it is absent or does not function correctly.
ADVATE is used in patients with haemophilia A to prevent or treat spontaneous bleeding or bleeding after surgery.
ADVATE is produced without the addition of any human or animal protein during the cell culture process, purification and final formulation.
WHAT MUST YOU MAKE NOTE BEFORE USING ADVATE?
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to Octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients
- if you are allergic to mouse or hamster protein.
If in doubt, ask your doctor.
Special care is required when using ADVATE. You should inform your doctor if you have recently been treated with Factor VIII products, especially if you have developed inhibitors.
Inhibitors are neutralizing antibodies against Factor VIII, which reduce the effectiveness of ADVATE in preventing or controlling bleeding.
The development of inhibitors is a well-known complication of hemophilia A treatment.
If your bleeding cannot be controlled with ADVATE, contact your doctor immediately.
There is little chance that you will develop an anaphylactic reaction (a sudden, severe, allergic reaction) to ADVATE.
You should be aware of early signs of such
These symptoms can be early signs of anaphylactic shock, which can also include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness, and extreme breathing difficulties.
If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe symptoms such as:
Breathing difficulties and (near-fainting) need immediate emergency treatment.
If you are taking other medicines, please inform your doctor if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken them, even if they are non-prescription medicines.
Pregnancy and lactation Inform your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Your doctor will decide if you can use ADVATE during pregnancy and lactation.
The usability and operation of ADVATE machines has no effect on the usability and operation of machines.
Important information about certain other ingredients of ADVATE This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol of sodium (10 mg) per vial.
This needs to be taken into account for patients who are on a sodium-restricted diet.
The treatment with ADVATE is initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia A.
Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or I.E.) depending on your physical condition and body weight, and whether it is used to prevent or treat bleeding.
The frequency of intake depends on how well ADVATE works for you.
Usually the replacement therapy with ADVATE is carried out for life.
Prevention of bleeding The usual dosage of Octocog alfa is 20-40 I.E.per kg body weight, administered every 2-3 days.
In some cases, however, more frequent injections or higher doses may be required, especially in younger patients.
Treatment of bleeding The dose of Octocog alfa is calculated according to body weight and the target factor VIII- levels.
The required Factor VIII level depends on the severity and location of the bleeding.
Dose (I.E.) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII- increase (% of normal value) x 0.5
If you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, inform your doctor.
Your doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests at regular intervals to ensure that you have adequate Factor VIIII- levels.
This is particularly important for larger surgical procedures.
Patients who develop Factor VIII- inhibitors If the expected Factor VIII- levels in your plasma cannot be reached with ADVATE or the bleeding cannot be controlled, this could be due to the development of Factor VIII-
99 inhibitors. This will be clarified by your doctor.
You may need higher doses of ADVATE or even another product to control bleeding.
Do not increase the dosage of ADVATE to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor.
How ADVATE is used ADVATE is usually administered by the doctor into a vein (intravenously).
If you or someone else administers ADVATE, it must only be administered after appropriate training.
At the end of the leaflet you will find detailed information on self-treatment.
If you have used a larger amount of ADVATE than you should, always apply ADVATE exactly as recommended by your doctor.
Ask your doctor if you are not sure.
If you have used a larger quantity, please consult your doctor as soon as possible.

Questions and Answers on the withdrawal of the application for marketing authorisation of Advexin
International Freiname (INN): Contusugene Ladenovec
On December 17, 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it was withdrawing its application for marketing authorization for Advexin for the treatment of lung cancer.
Advexin was designated an orphan medicine on 23 October 2006.
Advexin is an injection suspension containing Contusugene Ladenovec, a genetically modified virus carrying the p53 gene.
What should Advexin be used for?
Advexin should have been used to treat lung cancer in patients aged 18 and over.
Li-Fraumeni cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome in which the so-called p53 gene is defective due to a mutation. People with this mutation are more likely to develop cancer.
Liver cancer can occur in many parts of the body.
Normally, however, the breast, brain, bones or soft tissues (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.
The active ingredient in Advexin, Contusugene Ladenovec, is a viral vector.
This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.
The virus in Advexin is an adenovirus that has been modified in such a way that it cannot make copies of itself and thus cannot cause infection in humans.
The gene carrying the virus in Advexin is the normal (not defective) p53 gene.
Advexin should have been injected directly into the tumours, allowing the cancer cells to reproduce the normal p53 protein.
The p53 protein, which is made up of the non-defective p53 gene present in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and the killing of cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.
Because cancer cells contain damaged DNA, the p53 protein helps restore the DNA or causes the cells to die.
In cancer of the liver, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.
Advexin should have cured the disease or slowed its progression by restoring the normal protective function of the cells.
What documents did the company submit to the CHMP in support of its application?
The effects of Advexin were initially tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The company presented data from a study with a patient who had lymphoma of the lower abdomen, bones and brain.
The patient received 12 Advexin injections over a five-month period, which were injected into some of the tumors.

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged.
The efficacy of the drug was evaluated using scans to determine how the tumors responded to the treatment, and the company also presented results from several small studies evaluating the effects of a dose range of Advexin on various cancers. At what stage of evaluation was the application at the time of withdrawal?
When the company withdrew its application, day 179 was reached in the application process.
After the CHMP reviewed the company's responses to the questions put to it, some questions remained unanswered.
The CHMP typically takes up to 210 days to assess a new application.
Based on the review of the documents initially filed, the CHMP will draw up a list of questions on day 120, which will be sent to the company.
Once the company has provided answers to these questions, they will be reviewed by the CHMP.
Before the CHMP issues an opinion, it can ask the company any remaining questions on Day 180.
What was the CHMP's recommendation at that time?
Based on the company's audited data and responses to the CHMP's list of questions, there were some concerns on the part of the CHMP at the time of the withdrawal. The Committee took the preliminary view that Advexin could not have been approved for the treatment of lipoprotein cancer.
What were the main concerns of the CHMP?
According to the CHMP, there has not been sufficient evidence that the injection of advexin into lipoprotein tumours brings benefits to patients.
The Committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicinal product in the body, the method of administration and the safety of the medicinal product.
Furthermore, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment or to people who come into close contact with the patient.
On what grounds has the company withdrawn the application?
The letter informing the EMEA of the withdrawal of the application can be found here.
What are the consequences of the withdrawal for patients currently participating in clinical trials or Compassion Use programs with Advexin?
The company did not notify the CHMP whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or Compassion Use programs with Advexin.
This document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to reach recommendations on the use of the medicinal product.
If you need more information about your disease or its treatment, please read the package leaflet (also part of EPAR), or consult your doctor or pharmacist.

Aerinaze is a medicine containing the medicinal ingredients desloratadine (2.5 mg) and pseudoephedrine (120 mg).
It is available as blue and white tablets with modified drug release. Modified drug release means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the active ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours.
Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (nasal congestion).
The medicine is only available on doctor's prescription.
For adults and adolescents 12 years and older, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily is a tablet to be taken with a glass of water with or without food.
The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and should be stopped as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (blocked nose), have subsided.
A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug on nasal constipation may decrease.
Once the nose is clear, patients can take desloratadine alone.
Aerinaze contains two medicinal ingredients:
Desloratadine, an antihistamine, and pseudoephedrine, a nasal decongestant.
Desloratadine blocks the receptors to which histamine, an endogenous substance that causes allergic symptoms, normally attaches.
When the receptors are blocked, histamine is unable to work and this leads to alleviation of allergy symptoms.
Pseudoephedrine stimulates the nerve endings to release the chemical messenger substance norepinephrine, which causes constriction (narrowing) of the blood vessels.
This results in less fluid escaping from the vessels, so that the swelling decreases and the nose secretes less mucus.
Aerinaze combines two medicinal ingredients because an antihistamine alone often does not sufficiently relieve symptoms in patients with nasal constipation.

( 44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 Email: mail.emea.europa.eu https: / / www.emea.europa.eu EMEA 2007 Reproduction and distribution of this document is authorized for non-commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is approved Aerinaze tablets consist of two layers, one containing desloratadine and the other containing pseudoephedrine. Desloratadine is released from its layer immediately after ingestion, while pseudoephedrine is released slowly over 12 hours.
The efficacy of Aerinaze was investigated in two major studies with a total of 1,248 adult and adolescent patients.
In both studies, Aerinaze was compared to desloratadine alone and to pseudoephedrine alone.
The main efficacy measures were changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by patients before the start of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.
During the study, patients entered their symptoms in a diary every 12 hours and used a standard scale to assess how severe the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.
What benefits has Aerinaze shown in these studies?
Aerinaze relieved the symptoms more effectively than the two drugs alone.
When looking at all hay fever symptoms except nose constipation, patients taking Aerinaze reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms compared to 35.9% for patients taking pseudoephedrine alone.
If only swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, patients taking Aerinaze showed a relief of symptoms of 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients taking desloratadine alone.
Similar results were observed in the second study.
The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart attacks), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), pharyngitis (pharyngitis), anorexia (loss of appetite), constipation, headaches, fatigue, insomnia, somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disturbances and nervousness.
The full list of side effects reported in connection with Aerinaze can be found in the package leaflet.
Aerinaze should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, adrenergic agents or loratadine (another medicinal product used to treat allergies).
It should not be used in patients who take a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (such as some anti-depressant drugs) or who have stopped taking such a medicine in the last two weeks.
Aerinaze may also not be used in patients suffering from constriction glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), urinary retention (difficult urination), cardiovascular disease including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidism), or who have already had a haemorrhagic stroke (stroke caused by a cerebral haemorrhage) or are at risk of a haemorrhagic stroke.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Aerinaze in the symptomatic treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis with nasal swelling outweigh the risks and recommended authorisation for the marketing of Aerinaze.
On 30 July 2007, the European Commission authorised SP Europe to market Aerinaze throughout the European Union.
The full text of EPAR for Aerinaze can be found here.

Each tablet contains 2.5 mg desloratadine and 120 mg pseudoephedrine (as sulfate).
See Section 6.1 for the complete list of other components.
Oval tablet with a blue and a white layer, the blue layer bears the embossing D12.
Symptomatic treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis with accompanying nasal mucosal swelling.
Adults and adolescents from 12 years:
The recommended dosage of Aerinaze is one tablet twice daily.
The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but must be swallowed whole (i.e. without biting, breaking or chewing).
It can be taken independently of meals.
Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age due to the lack of safety and efficacy data (see Section 5.1).
The duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms subside.
It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, as the activity of pseudoephedrine may decrease over time in long-term use.
After decreasing the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper airways, treatment with desloratadine as monotherapy can be continued as required.
Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient, one of the other ingredients, adrenergic agents or loratadine.
Because Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO<unk> inhibitor) or within 2 weeks of completion of such therapy.
Aerinaze is also contraindicated in patients with:
2.
- Urinary retention, cardiovascular diseases such as ischemic heart disease, tachyarrhythmia and severe hypertension, hyperthyroidism, haemorrhagic stroke in history or risk factors that may increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke due to alphamimetic activity when combined with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolide, lisuride, cabergoline, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or other decongestants used perorally or nasally as decongestants (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazoline, etc.).
The recommended dosage and duration of treatment must not be exceeded (see section 4.2).
Patients over the age of 60 are more likely to experience adverse events with sympathomimetics such as pseudoephedrine.
The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been evaluated for this patient population and the data are insufficient to make appropriate dosage recommendations.
Therefore caution should be exercised when using the combination preparation in patients over 60 years of age.
The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze have not been tested in patients with renal or liver dysfunction, and the data are insufficient to recommend appropriate dosage.
The combination preparation is not recommended for use in patients with impaired kidney or liver function.
Aerinaze may not be used on children under 12 years of age (see section 4.2).
Patients must be informed that treatment must be discontinued in the event of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or aggravation of headaches).
Sympathomimetic amines can cause central nervous system stimulation with seizures or cardiovascular collapse with hypotension.
These effects are more likely in children, elderly patients or in the event of an overdose (see section 4.9).
Caution should be exercised when treating the following patient groups: patients under Digitalis Patients with arrhythmias Patients with hypertension Patients with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, bladder obstruction or bronchospasm in the history.
Caution should be taken when using in patients with stenosis of stomach ulcers and pyloroduodenal obstruction.
Caution is also advised for patients treated with other sympathomimetics.
These include: decongestants anorectics or psychostimulants of amphetamine type 3 antihypertensives tricyclic antidepressants and other antihistamines.
Caution should also be exercised in patients with migraine who are treated simultaneously with vasoconstricting ergotalkaloids.
Continued use can lead to a tolerance that leads to an increased risk of overdose.
Acute hypertension may occur perioperatively if volatile halogenated anaesthetics are used during therapy with indirect sympathomimetics.
Therefore, in case of surgical intervention, it is preferable to stop treatment 24 hours before the start of anaesthesia.
Athletes must be made aware that positive doping tests are possible under therapy with pseudoephedrine.
Aerinaze should be discontinued at least 48 hours before conducting dermatological tests, as antihistamines can otherwise prevent or reduce the extent of positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
However, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadine were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered.
Reversible and irreversible MAO inhibitors can increase the risk of vasoconstriction and hypertension.
Simultaneous use of sympathomimetics can lead to critical hypertonic reactions.
The following concomitant therapies are not recommended: Bromocriptin Cabergoline Lisuride, Pergolide: Risk of vasoconstriction and hypertension.
Dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergometrin: risk of vasoconstriction and hypertension.
Other active substances with vasoconstricting effects that are used orally or nasally as decongestant rhinologics (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazoline, etc.):
Sympathomimetics can reduce the antihypertensive effects of -methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine, veratrum alkaloids and guanethidine.
The absorption rate of pseudoephedrine sulfate is increased by antacids and reduced by kaolin.
The interaction between Aerinaze and alcohol was not investigated.
In a clinical pharmacological study, when desloratadine and alcohol were taken simultaneously, the
4. Results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between patients treated with desloratadine and those treated with placebo, regardless of whether desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.
The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not yet been identified, so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded.
Desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of Pglycoprotein.
In animal experiments neither desloratadine nor the combination of loratadine and pseudoephedrine was teratogenic.
The safety of the use of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, but experience from a large number of affected pregnancies has not shown an increase in the frequency of malformations compared to the frequency in the normal population.
Aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy as reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine.
Desloratadine and pseudoephedrine pass into breast milk.
Decreased milk production has been reported by nursing mothers in connection with pseudoephedrine.
Therefore, Aerinaze should not be used during breastfeeding.
4.7 Effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machines
No studies have been carried out on the impact of Aerinaze on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machinery.
No impairment was found in patients receiving desloratadine in clinical trials to assess roadworthiness.
Patients should be made aware, however, that in very rare cases lightheadedness can occur, which can lead to impairment of mobility or the ability to operate machinery.
Pseudoephedrine sulfate is not expected to impair psychomotor performance.
In clinical trials with 414 adults, the most common adverse events were insomnia (8.9%), dry mouth (7.2%) and headaches (3.1%).
These and other adverse events that occurred in clinical trials are listed in the table below.
