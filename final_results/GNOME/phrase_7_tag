The path from the original position to the target position must be free, which means you cannot jump over other objects.
A straight horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of five or more items is removed from the tableau. In this case, you will also receive an additional turn where no additional items are added to the tableau.
The play is over when the tableau is full, because then no object can be moved.
You score points by forming rows of five or more items; the points you can score depend on the number of items it removes.

A brief introduction to the possibilities of marking with F-Spot
There are several ways to search for tags.
First method: Double click on the tags you want to search for.
Drag the tags you want to search for in the search box you just checked.
To exclude a marker from your search:
Double click the flag you want to exclude in the bar. This will first add it to the search bar.
Then double-click the marker you want to exclude in the search bar.
As with adding tags, there are two basic methods to remove tags from your photos.
Select the photos you want to remove a marker from.
In the bar, select a marker you want to remove from the photos you select.
Click the photos with the right mouse button.
Deleting tags completely removes them from the system, but leaves behind the photos to which this tag is associated.
Select the marker to remove from the marker pane.
Create tags that can be associated with photos
To use tags at all, you first need to create a set of tags. There are three basic methods for creating tags.
Select the photos you want to assign the new marker to.
Select photos you want to add a marker to.
In the bar, select a marker you want to add to the selected photos.
Rate your photos with one to five stars
By double-clicking, select the photo you want to rate.
In the lower right corner you see five points related to the rating to be awarded. For example, to give a star, click on the first point.
Select the photo (s) for rating.
Right click on the photo (s) to be rated and select a rating at the bottom of the context menu by clicking on the appropriate item.
To search for photos by rating stars:
Select the range of ratings for the photos to view.
To stop searching for rating stars:
Select the photos you want to upload.
Imported scrolls are piles of imported photos. Regardless of the actual date the image was taken, the timestamp of importing the photos is decisive here.
To search for the latest imported role:
First, you will probably want to import photos.
Select a source for importing, such as a device or folder.
You have three ways to rotate a selected photo:
Click the appropriate rotary button to the right of the import button.
Use the parenthesis keys to rotate the photo.
Select the rotation angle in the range from -45 to 45 degrees.
Select an aspect ratio, i.e. a ratio between height and width to match the new photo. Examples of aspect ratios are 4x3, 4x6 and 5x7.
Click and drag to select the area to get. You can still move this rectangle as a whole after the size has been selected.

To automatically improve the colors of a photo:
Select the photo you want to improve by double-clicking it.
Select a time frame from which you want to view photos. To do so, select a set time frame or use dates.
Alternatively, you can use the timeline. To use the timeline:
In the timeline, click the bar of the time frame you want to view.
This mode removes the colors, converting a colored image to a black and white image.
This mode simulates a photo taken with sepia tint.
This mode automatically synchronizes colors with a set profile.
Of the editing tools in F-Spot, color adjustment is probably the most powerful tool. Color adjustment allows you to:
This simulates lengthening or shortening the shutter speed.
This setting allows adjusting the color intensity in a picture. Moving to the left reduces colors down to black and white, while Moving to the right intensifies colors.
This setting increases the brightness of colors. A too high value makes colors look washed out, while a too low value makes the image too dark and low in contrast.
This setting lets colors rotate along the color wheel <unk>.
This setting adjusts the contrast ratio, i.e. the difference between light and dark pixels. Moving to the left reduces contrast, while moving to the right increases contrast.
This setting changes the color temperature measured in Kelvin.
This setting allows you to tint your photos with one color.
Convert to black and white with controls. Requires Mono 2.2.
This extension allows you to burn your photos to a CD.
This extension allows you to export your photos to Flickr and 23hq.
This extension allows you to export your photos as HTML galleries, original galleries, or to a folder.
This extension allows you to export your photos to a PHP gallery (http<unk> / <unk> gallery.menalto.com).
This extension allows you to export your photos to PicasaWeb.
This extension allows you to export your photos to SmugMug.
This extension allows you to export your photos to Tabblo.
NOT STABLE - Please make sure you make a backup of photos.db before testing this extension. This extension allows you to change the base path of your photos. It is very convenient e.g. to move your photos from <unk> / Photos to / OurPhotos. Just make sure that SqLite can implement the changes for a few hours after f-spot has finished. Only the path to your photos in the Photos folder will be changed.

Starts a new game with all available variants.
Starts a new game that only contains logic puzzles.
Starts a new game containing only arithmetic exercises.
Starts a new game consisting only of memory exercises.
Starts a new game that contains only verbal analogies.
Always read the instructions carefully when playing a game!
The play session starts by displaying the problem and asking for the answer. At the bottom of the window you will find the main controls used to control the game.
<unk> <unk> image: <unk> figures/ gbrainy.png <unk>; md5<unk> d3b523ab1c8d00d00560d3f036d681bb
It includes different types of play such as logic puzzles, brain arithmetic tasks, memory exercises, and verbal analogies designed to test different cognitive abilities.
If you answer a task incorrectly, you receive no points for it.
If you answer a task correctly, you will score points that depend both on the time it took to solve the problem and on whether a clue was consulted during play.
The following table summarizes the different playing times (in seconds) depending on the difficulty level.
Based on the time expected for the selected difficulty and the time needed for the exercise, the following logic is used:
If you are faster than the expected time, you score 10 points.
If you are slower than expected, you will score 8 points.
If you take more than twice as long as the expected time, you score 7 points.
If you take more than three times as long as the expected time, you score 6 points.
If you use a hint, you get only 80% of the original result.
This means that for medium difficulty, in at least 20 games of each type, you need to score 10 points to get a final score of 100 points.
This may sound demanding, but it allows players to compare results from different sessions in the game history and track the progress of the player in all completed tasks.
Use the various check boxes below the graph to select the results to display in the graph.
To change the number of saved sessions or how many games are saved in the history, proceed as follows:
Use the first control box to change the number of play sessions that need to be saved so that the results are shown for the first time in the history graph.
The second control panel is used to change the number of play sessions shown in the history graph.
To change the difficulty of a game, proceed as follows:
Use the clues to solve a puzzle.
Some games offer simple hints that can be helpful in solving the problem.
This feature is not available for some games.
To stop a game so that you can resume it at a later time, perform one of the following steps:
To resume play after it has been paused, perform one of the following steps:
To exit a game, perform the following steps:

Tasks that challenge your reasoning and reasoning skills. These puzzles are based on sequences of elements, visual and spatial conclusions, or connections between elements.
Tasks based on arithmetic operations to improve your brain computing skills. In these exercises, the player has to combine multiplication, division, addition and subtraction and use them in different ways.
Tasks that test your short term memory. These exercises are collections of items that the player should memorize. Sometimes, they are associations between elements, words, numbers, or colors.
Games that require your verbal dexterity. These tasks ask the player to find causes and effects, use synonyms or opposites, and check the vocabulary.
