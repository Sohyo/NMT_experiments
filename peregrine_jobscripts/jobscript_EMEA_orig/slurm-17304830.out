2021-01-17 12:35:36 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Actrapide has been studied in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin (two studies involving 1,954 patients), and in type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot process insulin effectively (a study involving 182 patients), when Actrapide was compared with a human insulin analogue (insulin Aspart) by measuring the concentration in the blood of a substance called glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), which indicates how well the blood glucose is controlled, for six months.
2021-01-17 12:35:36 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: HbA1c levels remained fairly steady over the six months of treatment with Actrapid.
