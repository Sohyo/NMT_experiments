2021-01-19 05:43:26 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: Actrapid has been studied in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin (two studies, in 1,954 patients), and in patients with type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot process insulin effectively (a study in 182 patients), whose studies compared Actrapid to a human insulin analogue (Insulin Aspart) by measuring the level in the blood of a substance called glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), which indicates how well the blood is glucose controlled, for six months.
2021-01-19 05:43:26 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: HbA1c levels remained fairly steady over the six months of treatment with Actrapid.
