Adenuric is a medicine containing the active substance Febuxostat.
It is supplied as yellow capsule shaped tablets (80 and 120 mg).
Adenuric is used to treat chronic (long term) hyperuricaemia (high levels of uric acid or urine in the blood).
In hyperuricaemia, urine crystals may form and deposit in the joints and kidneys.
When such deposition occurs in the joints and causes pain, it is called gout.
Adenuric is used in patients who already show signs of crystal deposition, including arthritis (pain and inflammation in the joints) or bile ducts (stones, i. e. larger urine crystal deposition, which may cause joint and bone damage).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
The recommended dose of Adenuric is 80 mg once a day.
It can be taken with or without meals.
Adenuric acid levels in the blood are usually lowered within two weeks.
Seizures of gout may still occur during the first month of treatment; therefore, it is recommended that patients take additional medicines to prevent attacks of gout at least during the first six months of treatment with Adenuric.
Treatment with Adenuric should not be discontinued if an attack of gout occurs.
The efficacy and safety of Adenuric have not been evaluated in patients with severe renal or hepatic problems.
The medicine is not recommended for children or patients who have had an organ transplant as it has not been studied in these groups.
Feboxustat, the active substance in Adenuric, reduces the formation of uric acid.
It works by inhibiting an enzyme called xanthine oxidase, which is necessary for the production of uric acid in the body.
By reducing uric acid production, Adenuric can reduce the

If the uric acid level is maintained at a low level for long enough, even existing bile ducts may become smaller.
The effects of Adenuric were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The effectiveness of Adenuric has been evaluated in two main studies involving a total of 1,834 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout.
The first, involving 1,072 patients, compared the effectiveness of three different doses of adenuric (80, 120 and 240 mg administered once a day) with placebo (a dummy medicine) and allopurinol (another medicine used to treat hyperuricaemia).
The second compared allopurinol to two doses of Adenuric (80 and 120 mg once a day) in 762 patients for one year.
In both trials, allopurinol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day; patients with renal problems received only 100 mg daily.
The main measure of efficacy was the number of patients whose blood uric acid levels were below 6 mg/ dl on the last three measurements.
The uric acid level in the blood was measured each month.
What benefit has Adenuric shown during the studies?
Adenuric acid was more effective than allopurinol and placebo at lowering uric acid levels in the blood.
In the first study, 48% (126 out of 262) of patients taking 80 mg of adenuric at once daily doses and 65% (175 out of 269) of patients taking 120 mg once daily had uric acid levels in the blood less than 6 mg/ dl at the last three measurements.
This compares with 22% (60 out of 268) of patients receiving allopurinol and none of the 134 receiving placebo.
The second produced similar results after one year.
The most frequent side effects with Adenuric (seen in 1 to 10 patients in 100) are headaches, diarrhoea, nausea, rash and abnormal liver values.
There may also be an increased risk of certain undesirable effects affecting the heart and blood vessels, especially in patients with a prior history of heart disease.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Adenuric, see the Package Leaflet.
Adenuric should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to feboxustat or any of the other ingredients.
Der Ausschuss für Humanarzneimittel (CHMP) gelangte zu dem Schluss, dass Adenuric bei der Senkung des Urnsärespiegels im Blut wirkwirkiger war als Allopurinol, jedoch auch eine höhere Risiko von Nebenwirkungen im Zusammenhang mit dem Herz und den BlutVesVesVesVesVesVessels geraten. Adenuric was more effective than allopurinol in lowering the uric acid level in the blood, but it could also contain a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels.
The Committee decided that Adenuric s benefits in the treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia, when urine deposits have already occurred, outweigh its risks and recommended that Adenuric be given marketing authorisation.
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Adenuric on 21 April 2008.

ADROVANCE is a white tablet in capsule form containing two active ingredients: sodium alendronate 3 H2O (70 mg) and colecalciferol (vitamin D3, 70 micrograms corresponding to 2800 international units IU).
This medicinal product is identical to FOSAVANCE, which is already approved in the European Union.
The manufacturer of FOSAVANCE has agreed that the scientific data of this product may also be used for ADROVANCE.
ADROVANCE is used to treat osteoporosis (a disease in which bones become fragile) in post-menopausal women who are at risk for low levels of vitamin D.
ADROVANCE reduces the risk of spine and hip fractures (fractures).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
The recommended dose is one tablet once a week.
The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking any other medicinal products, including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements.
In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient should not lie down until after the first intake of food of the day, which should be 30 minutes after the tablet is taken at the earliest.
Do not chew or melt the tablet.
Patients should also take additional calcium if insufficient intake is achieved through food.
For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
Bone tissue is a living tissue that is constantly renewed as old bone tissue is broken down and replaced by new bone.
Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones gradually become thin and fragile, with increased susceptibility to fractures (fractures).
This occurs when not enough new bone tissue grows to replace the naturally broken down bone.
Osteoporosis occurs primarily in post-menopausal women (after the 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

Alendronate is a biphosphonate used to treat osteoporosis since the mid 1990s.
It inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, cells involved in the breakdown of bone tissue. By blocking the activity of these cells, alendronate slows down bone loss. Vitamin D3 is a nutrient found in some foods but also produced in the skin when exposed to natural sunlight. Vitamin D3, like other forms of vitamin D, is required for calcium uptake and normal bone formation and since patients with osteoporosis may not produce enough vitamin D3 from the sun, it is included in ADROVANCE.
As alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicinal products authorised in the European Union, the company presented data from previous studies and published literature.
The company also conducted a study in 35 men and 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis to determine if ADROVANCE is effective in increasing vitamin D levels.
Patients received either ADROVANCE or alendronate once a week.
The main measure of efficacy was the percentage of patients with low vitamin D levels.
What benefit has ADROVANCE shown during the studies?
After 15 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than that in those taking alendronate alone (32%).
The company also presented data showing that the alendronate dose in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.
The most frequent side effects (observed in 1 to 10 patients in 100) are headaches, musculoskeletal pains (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, ulcera of the oesophagus, dysphagia, distended abdomen and acid regurgitation.
For the full list of all side effects reported with ADROVANCE, see the Package Leaflet.
In patients with possible hypersensitivity (allergy) to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients, ADROVANCE should not be used.
It should not be used in patients with oesophageal disorders, patients with hypocalcaemia (low levels of calcium) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.
Der Ausschuss für Humanarzneimittel (CHMP) gewählt, dass die Vorteile von ADROVANCE bei der Behandlung von Osteoporose bei postmenopausalen Patientinnen mit Risiko eines Vitamin-D- Deficiency gegenüber den Risiken überwiegen, und empfahl, die Genehmigung für das Inverkehrbringen von ADROVANCE zu erteilen. The Committee recommended that ADROVANCE be given marketing authorisation.
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for ADROVANCE to Merck Sharp <unk> Dohme Ltd. on 4 January 2007.
The full EPAR for ADROVANCE is available here.
Each tablet contains 70 mg alendronic acid as sodium alendronate 3 H2O and 70 micrograms (2,800 IU) of colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Each tablet contains 62 mg lactose and 8 mg sucrose.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Capsule shaped, white to broken white tablets marked with the outline of a bone on one side and 710 on the other.
Treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in patients at risk for vitamin D deficiency.
ADROVANCE reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.
The recommended dose is one ADROVANCE tablet once a week.
Given the course of osteoporosis, ADROVANCE is scheduled for long term therapy.
Notes on how to ensure adequate absorption of alendronate:
ADROVANCE should only be taken with water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, drink or intake of medicinal products (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.
Other beverages (including mineral water), foods and some medicinal products may interfere with the absorption of alendronate (see section 4.5).
The following advice should be closely followed in order to reduce the risk of oesophageal irritation and related undesirable effects (see section 4.4):
Patients should not chew the tablet or allow the tablet to melt in their mouth because of the risk of oropharyngeal ulcers; they should not lie down before their first food intake of the day, which should be 30 minutes after taking the tablet at the earliest.
Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking ADROVANCE. ADROVANCE should not be taken before going to bed or getting up for the first time.
Patients should be supplemented with calcium if nutritional care is insufficient (see section 4.4).
Additional vitamin D supplementation should be considered on an individual basis, taking into account vitamin D intake through vitamin D supplements and supplements.
The equivalent of taking 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 once a week in ADROVANCE and 400 IU of vitamin D once a day has not been investigated.
In clinical trials there was no age related difference in the efficacy or safety profile of alendronate.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required in the elderly.
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 35 ml/ min.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for patients with renal impairment with GFR less than 35 ml/ min due to lack of experience.
ADROVANCE has not been studied in children and adolescents and therefore should not be used in them.
Hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients or to the excipients. Oesophagus disorders and other factors that delay oesophageal emptying, such as strictures or achalasia. Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes. Hypocalcaemia.
Alendronate Alendronate may cause local irritation of the mucous membranes of the upper gastrointestinal tract.
Due to the potential for worsening of the underlying disease, special care should be taken with alendronate in patients with active gastrointestinal disease, such as dysphagia, oesophagus, gastritis, duodenitis, ulceration, or with recent (within the last year) severe gastrointestinal disease, such as peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal haemorrhage, or surgery in the upper gastrointestinal tract, except for pyloroplasty (see section 4.3).
Oesophageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosions, rarely followed by oesophageal strictures, have been reported in patients taking alendronate (some of these were severe and required hospitalization).
The physician should therefore be attentive to all signs and symptoms indicative of possible oesophageal reactions and patients should be advised to discontinue the medicine and seek medical advice if symptoms of oesophageal irritation appear, such as dysphagia, pain when swallowing or retrostar pain or new or worsening heartburn (see section 4.8).
The risk of severe oesophageal adverse reactions appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and/ or continue to take it after the onset of symptoms indicative of oesophageal irritation.
It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and are understood by the patient (see section 4.2).
Patients should be informed that failure to adhere to these instructions may result in an increased risk of oesophageal problems.
While no increased risk was observed in large scale clinical trials of alendronate, there have been rare reports of stomach and duodenal ulcers, some severe and with complications (see section 4.8).
Osteonecrosis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis) has been reported in cancer patients whose regimens contain predominantly intravenous bisphosphonates.
Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has also been reported with oral bisphosphonates in patients with osteoporosis.
Dental examination with appropriate preventive measures should be preceded by treatment with bisphosphonates if patients exhibit corresponding risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, periodontitis).
While on treatment, these patients should avoid orthodontic surgery as much as possible.
If patients develop osteonecrosis of the jaw during bisphosphonate therapy, jaw surgery may exacerbate the condition.
Data are not available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy in patients requiring maxillofacial surgery may reduce the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
The clinical assessment of the treating physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient on the basis of an individual benefit-risk assessment.
Bone, joint and/ or muscle pain have been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates.
These symptoms were rarely severe and/ or associated with marketed use (see section 4.8).
The timing of onset of these symptoms varied from one day to several months after initiation of therapy.
In most patients, symptoms decreased after discontinuation of therapy.
In some patients, symptoms reappeared when therapy was resumed with the same medicine or with another bisphosphonate.
Patients should be instructed to take the tablet the next morning if they fail to take a dose of ADROVANCE after they realise they have failed.
You should not take two tablets on the same day but should continue to take one tablet per week on the day of the week as originally planned.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for renal insufficiency patients with GFR less than 35 ml/ min (see section 4.2).
Other possible causes of osteoporosis besides oestrogen deficiency and age should be considered.
Existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected before ADROVANCE therapy is initiated (see section 4.3).
Other disorders that impair mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be adequately treated prior to initiating therapy with ADROVANCE.
The vitamin D content of ADROVANCE is not suitable for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency.
In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcaemia should be monitored during therapy with ADROVANCE.
Decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur as a result of stimulation of bone mineralisation by alendronate.
However, rare cases of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, some severe, have been reported and are common in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (e. g. hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption) (see section 4.8).
Colecalciferol Vitamin D3 may increase the risk of hypercalcaemia and/ or hypercalciuria when given to patients with illnesses associated with uncontrolled overproduction of calcitriol (e. g. leucaemia, lymphoma, sarcoidosis).
Urine and serum calcium should be monitored in these patients.
Malabsorbed patients may not be taking enough vitamin D3.
Excipients This medicinal product contains lactose and sucrose.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicinal product.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may impair the absorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.
Therefore, after receiving alendronate, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking any other medicinal products (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
No other clinically relevant interaction with medicinal products is expected.
In clinical trials, several patients were receiving oestrogen (intravaginal, transdermal or oral) concomitantly with alendronate.
Adverse reactions attributable to this combination of medicinal products have not been observed.
Although specific interaction studies have not been performed, in clinical trials alendronate has been administered concomitantly with a variety of commonly prescribed medicinal products without clinically relevant interactions.
This process is influenced by several factors (e. g. cholestyramine, colestipol) which may impair the absorption of vitamin D.
Anticonvulsants, cimetidine and thiazides may increase the degradation metabolism of vitamin D.
An additional vitamin D supplement should be considered on an individual basis.
ADROVANCE is for use in post-menopausal women only and therefore should not be used in pregnancy or in breast-feeding women.
There are no adequate data on the use of ADROVANCE in pregnant women.
Animal studies of alendronate show no evidence of any direct harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal or postnatal development.
Alendronate given to pregnant rats caused dystocia associated with hypocalcaemia (see section 5.3).
Hypercalcaemia and toxicity to reproduction (see section 5.3) have been demonstrated in animal studies at high doses of vitamin D.
Alendronate is not known to be converted into human milk.
Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites are released into human milk.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on ability to drive or use machines have been performed.
However, there is no information to suggest that ADROVANCE impairs the ability to drive or use machines.
The following undesirable effects have been reported during clinical trials and/ or post-marketing of alendronate.
No other undesirable effects were observed for ADROVANCE.
Common (1/ 100, <unk> 1/ 10), uncommon (1/ 1,000, <unk> 1/ 100), rare (1/ 10,000, <unk> 1/ 1,000), very rare (<unk> 1/ 10,000) <unk>
Common: abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, oesophageal ulcos*, dysphagy*, distended abdominal tissue, acid regurgitation. Uncommon: nausea, vomiting, gastritis, oesophagitis*, oesophageal erosion*, melenia. Rare: oesophagus strict*, oropharyngeal ulceration*, perforations, ulcers and haemorrhages in the upper gastrointestinal tract (see section 4.4<unk>. * See sections 4.2 and 4.4.
Skin rash, pruritus, erythema. Rare: rash with photosensitivity. Very rare: severe skin reactions including Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Common: musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain.
Rare: severe musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain (see section 4.4).
Rare: symptomatic hypocalcaemia, usually in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (see section 4.4).
Rare: transient symptoms of acute phase reaction (myalgia, malaise and rare fever), usually at the start of therapy.
The following reactions were reported after launch (frequency not known):
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates; most of the reports are from cancer patients but this has also been reported in patients with osteoporosis.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw is usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis).
Cancer diagnosis, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, corticosteroids and inadequate oral hygiene are also considered risk factors (see section 4.4).
Laboratory values In clinical trials, asymptomatic, mild and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in about 18% and 10% of patients taking alendronate 10 mg/ day, respectively, compared to about 12% and 3% of those taking placebo.
However, decreases in serum calcium to <unk> 8.0 mg/ dl (2.0 mmol/ l) and serum phosphate to 2.0 mg/ dl (0.65 mmol/ l) occurred with a similar frequency in both treatment groups.
Alendronate Hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia and upper gastrointestinal side effects such as indigestion, heartburn, oesophagitis, gastritis or ulceration may occur as a consequence of an oral overdose.
Specific experience in the treatment of overdose with alendronate is not available.
In case of an overdose with ADROVANCE, milk or antacids should be given to bind alendronate.
Vomiting should not be initiated and the patient should remain upright because of the risk of oesophageal irritation.
Colecalciferol In long term therapy in generally healthy adults, vitamin D toxicity has not been documented at doses less than 10,000 IU/ day; in a clinical trial in healthy adults, the daily dose was 4,000 IU.
Vitamin D3 not associated with hypercalciuria or hypercalcaemia for up to 5 months.
ADROVANCE is a combination tablet containing the two active ingredients sodium alendronate 3 H2O and colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Alendronate Sodium alendronate 3 H2O is a bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts without exerting a direct effect on bone formation.
Preclinic studies have shown that alendronate is preferred at sites of active absorption
Osteoclastic activity is inhibited, but osteoclastic recruiting and binding are not affected.
The bone formed during therapy with alendronate is of normal quality.
Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3.
In case of inadequate exposure to the sun, it is essential that vitamin D3 is included in the diet.
Vitamin D3 is converted by the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and stored until it is needed.
Renal conversion to the active calcium mobilising hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) is strictly regulated.
The main effect of 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and to regulate serum calcium, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone absorption.
Vitamin D3 is required for normal bone formation.
Vitamin D deficiency occurs when insufficient exposure to the sun and intake from food occurs.
Deficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, bone loss and an increased risk of skeletal fractures.
In severe cases, deficiency may lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphataemia, proximal muscle weakness, osteomalacia, and a further increased risk of falls and bone fractures in osteoporotic patients.
Vitamin D supplementation reduces these risks and their consequences.

Trials of ADROVANCE The effect of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronate/ 2,800 IU vitamin D3) on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15-week, multi-national trial in 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis (mean serum baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D: 56 nmol/ l <unk> 22.3 ng/ ml <unk>; range 22.5 225 nmol/ l <unk> 9-90 ng/ ml <unk>).
Patients received lower strength ADROVANCE (70 mg <unk> 2,800 IU) (n<unk> 350) or FOSAMAX (alendronate) 70 mg once weekly (n<unk> 332) with no other vitamin D supplements.
After 15 weeks of treatment, mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher (26%) in the ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (56 nmol/ l <unk> 23 ng/ ml <unk> group than in the alendronate group alone (46 nmol/ l <unk> 18.2 ng/ ml <unk>).
ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <unk> 37.5 nmol/ l <unk> 15 ng/ ml <unk>) by 62.5% after 15 weeks compared to alendronate alone (12% vs. 37.5 ng/ l <unk> 15 ng/ ml <unk>).

ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <unk> 22.5 nmol/ l <unk> 9 ng/ ml <unk>) by 92% compared to alendronate alone (1% vs. 13%).
In this study, mean serum values of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in patients with vitamin D insufficiency increased after 15 weeks at the start of the study (25-hydroxyvitamin D 22.5 to 37.5 nmol/ l <unk> 9 - <unk> 15 ng/ ml <unk>) from 30 nmol/ l (12.1 ng/ ml) to 40 nmol/ l (15.9 ng/ ml) in the group on ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n<unk> 75) and decreased from 30 nmol/ l (12.0 ng/ ml) at the start of the study to 26 nmol/ l (10.4 ng/ ml) in the group on alendronate alone (n<unk> 70).
There were no differences between treatment groups regarding the mean values of serum calcium, phosphate or calcium in 24 hour urine.
Trials of alendronate The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate 70 mg (n<unk> 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n<unk> 370) was demonstrated in a one-year, multi-centre study in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.
Increases above baseline lumbar spine BMD after one year were on average 5.1% (95% CI:
4.8, 5.4%) in the 70 mg weekly and 5.4% weekly (95% CI:
5.0, 5.8%) in the 10 mg daily group.
The mean increases in BMD were 2.3% and 2.9% for the femoral neck and 2.9% and 3.1% for the total hip in the 70 mg weekly and 10 mg daily group, respectively.
Treatment groups were also comparable in BMD increases at other skeletal sites.
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were examined in two phase II studies of identical design (n<unk> 944) and in the Fracture Intervention Study (FIT: n<unk> 6,459).
In the phase II trials, mean increases in BMD with alendronate 10 mg/ day in relation to placebo at 3 years were 8.8% at the spine, 5.9% at the femoral neck and 7.8% at the trochanter.
The BMD of the total keleton was also significantly increased.
In the alendronate treated group, a 48% reduction was achieved (alendronate 3.2% vs. placebo 6.2%) in the proportion of patients who sustained one or more vertebral fractures compared to the placebo group.
For the two year extension of these studies, the increases in BMD of the spine and trochanter continued and BMD of the femoral neck and of the entire body was also sustained.
FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled studies in which alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and thereafter 10 mg daily for either 1 or 2 years):
FIT 1: a three year trial involving 2,027 patients with at least one pre-existing spine / compression / fracture.
In this study, daily administration of alendronate reduced the incidence of at least one new vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% vs. placebo 15.0%).
In addition, a significant reduction in the incidence of hip fractures was observed (1.1% vs. 2.2%; 51% reduction).
FIT 2: a four year study in 4,432 patients with low bone mass but no pre-existing vertebral fracture.
This study found a significant difference in the incidence of hip fractures (alendronate 1.0% vs. placebo 2.2%; reduction 56%) and of at least one vertebral fracture (2.9% vs. 5.8%; reduction by 50%) in the analysis of the subgroup of osteoporotic women (37% of the total number who suffered from osteoporosis as defined above).
Absorption At a reference intravenous dose, the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nocturnal fasting and two hours prior to eating a standardized breakfast.
Bioavailability decreased correspondingly to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% when alendronate was administered one or half hour prior to a standardized breakfast.
In osteoporosis studies, alendronate was effective when taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.
The alendronate constituent of the ADROVANCE combination tablet (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) and the tablet of 70 mg alendronate are bioequivalent.
Bioavailability was minimal when alendronate was administered with or up to two hours after a standardized breakfast.
Alendronate concomitant administration of coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60%.
In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg 3 times daily for five days) did not cause clinically important changes in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (mean increase was 20% to 44%).
Distribution Studies in rats have shown that alendronate, administered intravenously (1 mg/ kg), temporarily spreads into soft tissue but then rapidly redistributes to bone or is excreted in the urine.
The mean steady state volume of distribution in man, except for bone, is at least 28 litres.
Plasma concentrations after intake of oral therapeutic doses of alendronate are too low for analytical detection (<unk> 5 ng/ ml).
The protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78%.
Biotransformation There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolised in animals or humans.
Excretion Following a single intravenous dose of 14C-alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactively labelled substance was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was recovered in the faeces.
Following a single intravenous dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml/ min and the systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml/ min.
Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95% within six hours after intravenous administration.
The terminal half-life in humans is estimated to be greater than ten years when factoring in the release of alendronate from the skeleton.
Alendronate is not excreted in rats by the acidic or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the excretion of other medicinal products by these transport systems in humans.
Absorption In healthy adult subjects (women and men), after nocturnal fasting and two hours before meals, the mean surface area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC0-120 h) for vitamin D3 was 296.4 ng h/ ml (excluding endogenous vitamin D3 levels).
The mean maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of vitamin D3 was 5.9 ng/ ml and the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (Tmax) was 12 hours.
The bioavailability of 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 in ADROVANCE is comparable to that of 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 taken on its own.
Distribution After absorption, vitamin D3 is absorbed by the blood as a component of chylomicrons.
Vitamin D3 is rapidly distributed, primarily to the liver, where it is metabolised into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the main storage.
Smaller amounts are distributed in fat and muscle tissue, where they are stored as vitamin D3 to be later released into the circulation.
Circulating vitamin D3 is bound to vitamin D-binding protein.
Biotransformation Vitamin D3 is rapidly hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and then metabolised in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the biologically active form.
Further hydroxylation occurs prior to excretion.
A small fraction of vitamin D3 is glucuronised before excretion.
Excretion Mean excretion of radioactivity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4% for healthy subjects and 4.9% for faeces after 4 days when radioactively labelled vitamin D3 was administered.
In both cases, radioactivity was excreted almost exclusively as metabolites of the starting substance.
The mean half-life of vitamin D3 in the serum is approximately 24 hours after an oral dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU).
Characteristics in patients Preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate not deposited in the bone is rapidly excreted in the urine.
No evidence exists that indicates saturation of the bone absorption capacity at long doses of cumulative intravenous doses up to
Although there are no clinical data on this, renal elimination of alendronate, as seen in animal studies, may be expected to be reduced even in patients with renal impairment.
Therefore, a somewhat increased accumulation of alendronate in bone may be expected in patients with impaired renal function (see section 4.2).
Non-clinical trials of the combination of alendronate and colecalciferol have not been performed.
Non-clinical data based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, chronic toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, reveal no special hazard for humans.
Studies in rats showed that administration of alendronate to pregnant rats was associated with the onset of dystocia in the dam due to hypocalcaemia.
In studies, high doses in rats increased the incidence of incomplete ossification in the foetus.
The significance of this observation for humans is unknown.
Colecalciferol In animal studies, reproductive toxicity was observed at doses much higher than the human therapeutic dose.

Treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in patients at risk for vitamin D deficiency not receiving additional vitamin D supplementation.
ADROVANCE reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.
The recommended dose is one ADROVANCE tablet once a week.
Given the course of osteoporosis, ADROVANCE is scheduled for long term therapy.
Notes on how to ensure adequate absorption of alendronate:
ADROVANCE should only be taken with water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, drink or intake of medicinal products (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.
Other beverages (including mineral water), foods and some medicinal products may interfere with the absorption of alendronate (see section 4.5).
The following advice should be closely followed in order to reduce the risk of oesophageal irritation and related undesirable effects (see section 4.4):
Patients should not chew the tablet or allow the tablet to melt in their mouth because of the risk of oropharyngeal ulcers; they should not lie down before their first food intake of the day, which should be 30 minutes after taking the tablet at the earliest.
Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking ADROVANCE. ADROVANCE should not be taken before going to bed or getting up for the first time.
Patients should be supplemented with calcium if nutritional care is insufficient (see section 4.4).
The equivalent of taking 5,600 IU.
Vitamin D3 once a week in ADROVANCE and from 800 IU.
Vitamin D once a day has not been studied.
In clinical trials there was no age related difference in the efficacy or safety profile of alendronate.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required in the elderly.
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 35 ml/ min.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for patients with renal impairment with GFR less than 35 ml/ min due to lack of experience.
ADROVANCE has not been studied in children and adolescents and therefore should not be used in them.
Hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients or to the excipients. Oesophagus disorders and other factors that delay oesophageal emptying, such as strictures or achalasia. Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes. Hypocalcaemia.
Alendronate Alendronate may cause local irritation of the mucous membranes of the upper gastrointestinal tract.
Due to the potential for worsening of the underlying disease, special care should be taken with alendronate in patients with active gastrointestinal disease, such as dysphagia, oesophagus, gastritis, duodenitis, ulceration, or with recent (within the last year) severe gastrointestinal disease, such as peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal haemorrhage, or surgery in the upper gastrointestinal tract, except for pyloroplasty (see section 4.3).
Oesophageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosions, rarely followed by oesophageal strictures, have been reported in patients taking alendronate (some of these were severe and required hospitalization).
The physician should therefore be attentive to all signs and symptoms indicative of possible oesophageal reactions and patients should be advised to discontinue the medicine and seek medical advice if symptoms of oesophageal irritation appear, such as dysphagia, pain when swallowing or retrostar pain or new or worsening heartburn (see section 4.8).
The risk of severe oesophageal adverse events appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and/ or continue to take it after the onset of symptoms indicative of oesophageal irritation.
It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient.
Patients should be informed that if they do not adhere to these instructions, the risk of oesophageal problems may be increased.
While no increased risk was observed in large scale clinical trials of alendronate, there have been rare reports of stomach and duodenal ulcers, some severe and with complications (see section 4.8).
Osteonecrosis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis) has been reported in cancer patients whose regimens contain predominantly intravenous bisphosphonates.
Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has also been reported with oral bisphosphonates in patients with osteoporosis.
Dental examination with appropriate preventive measures should be preceded by treatment with bisphosphonates if patients exhibit corresponding risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, periodontitis).
While on treatment, these patients should avoid orthodontic surgery as much as possible.
If patients develop osteonecrosis of the jaw during bisphosphonate therapy, jaw surgery may exacerbate the condition.
Data are not available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy in patients requiring maxillofacial surgery may reduce the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
The clinical assessment of the treating physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient on the basis of an individual benefit-risk assessment.
Bone, joint and/ or muscle pain have been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates.
These symptoms were rarely severe and/ or associated with marketed use (see section 4.8).
The timing of onset of these symptoms varied from one day to several months after initiation of therapy.
In most patients, symptoms decreased after discontinuation of therapy.
In some patients, symptoms reappeared when therapy was resumed with the same medicine or with another bisphosphonate.
Patients should be instructed to take the tablet the next morning if they fail to take a dose of ADROVANCE after they realise they have failed.
You should not take two tablets on the same day but should continue to take one tablet per week on the day of the week as originally planned.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for renal insufficiency patients with GFR less than 35 ml/ min (see section 4.2).
Other possible causes of osteoporosis besides oestrogen deficiency and age should be considered.
Existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected before ADROVANCE therapy is initiated (see section 4.3).
Other disorders that impair mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be adequately treated prior to initiating therapy with ADROVANCE.
The vitamin D content of ADROVANCE is not suitable for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency.
In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcaemia should be monitored during therapy with ADROVANCE.
Decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur as a result of stimulation of bone mineralisation by alendronate.
However, rare cases of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, some severe, have been reported and are frequently seen in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (e. g. hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption) (see section 4.8).
Colecalciferol Vitamin D3 may increase the risk of hypercalcaemia and/ or hypercalciuria when given to patients with illnesses associated with uncontrolled overproduction of calcitriol (e. g. leucaemia, lymphoma, sarcoidosis).
Urine and serum calcium should be monitored in these patients.
Malabsorbed patients may not be taking enough vitamin D3.
Excipients This medicinal product contains lactose and sucrose.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicinal product.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may impair the absorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.
Therefore, after receiving alendronate, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking any other medicinal products (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
No other clinically relevant interaction with medicinal products is expected.
In clinical trials, several patients were receiving oestrogen (intravaginal, transdermal or oral) concomitantly with alendronate.
Adverse reactions attributable to this combination of medicinal products have not been observed.
Although specific interaction studies have not been performed, in clinical trials alendronate has been administered concomitantly with a variety of commonly prescribed medicinal products without clinically relevant interactions.
This process is influenced by several factors (e. g. cholestyramine, colestipol) which may impair the absorption of vitamin D.
Anticonvulsants, cimetidine and thiazides may increase the degradation metabolism of vitamin D.
An additional vitamin D supplement should be considered on an individual basis.
ADROVANCE is for use in post-menopausal women only and therefore should not be used in pregnancy or in breast-feeding women.
There are no adequate data on the use of ADROVANCE in pregnant women.
Animal studies of alendronate show no evidence of any direct harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal or postnatal development.
Alendronate given to pregnant rats caused dystocia associated with hypocalcaemia (see section 5.3).
Hypercalcaemia and toxicity to reproduction (see section 5.3) have been demonstrated in animal studies at high doses of vitamin D.
It is not known whether alendronate is converted into human milk.
Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites are released into human milk.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on ability to drive or use machines have been performed.
However, there is no information to suggest that ADROVANCE impairs the ability to drive or use machines.
The following undesirable effects have been reported during clinical trials and/ or post-marketing of alendronate.
No other undesirable effects were observed for ADROVANCE.
Common (1/ 100, <unk> 1/ 10), uncommon (1/ 1,000, <unk> 1/ 100), rare (1/ 10,000, <unk> 1/ 1,000), very rare (<unk> 1/ 10,000) <unk>
Common: abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, oesophageal ulcos*, dysphagy*, distended abdominal tissue, acid regurgitation. Uncommon: nausea, vomiting, gastritis, oesophagitis*, oesophageal erosion*, melenia. Rare: oesophagus strict*, oropharyngeal ulceration*, perforations, ulcers and haemorrhages in the upper gastrointestinal tract (see section 4.4<unk>. * See sections 4.2 and 4.4.
Skin rash, pruritus, erythema. Rare: rash with photosensitivity. Very rare: severe skin reactions including Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Common: musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain.
Rare: severe musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain (see section 4.4).
Rare: symptomatic hypocalcaemia, usually in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (see section 4.4).
Rare: transient symptoms of acute phase reaction (myalgia, malaise and rare fever), usually at the start of therapy.
The following reactions were reported after launch (frequency not known):
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates; most of the reports are from cancer patients but this has also been reported in patients with osteoporosis.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw is usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis).
Cancer diagnosis, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, corticosteroids and inadequate oral hygiene are also considered risk factors (see section 4.4).
Laboratory values In clinical trials, asymptomatic, mild and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in about 18% and 10% of patients taking alendronate 10 mg/ day, respectively, compared to about 12% and 3% of those taking placebo.
However, decreases in serum calcium to <unk> 8.0 mg/ dl (2.0 mmol/ l) and serum phosphate to 2.0 mg/ dl (0.65 mmol/ l) occurred with a similar frequency in both treatment groups.
Alendronate Hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia and upper gastrointestinal side effects such as indigestion, heartburn, oesophagitis, gastritis or ulceration may occur as a consequence of an oral overdose.
Specific experience in the treatment of overdose with alendronate is not available.
In case of an overdose with ADROVANCE, milk or antacids should be given to bind alendronate.
Vomiting should not be initiated and the patient should remain upright because of the risk of oesophageal irritation.
Colecalciferol In long term therapy in generally healthy adults, vitamin D toxicity has not been documented at doses less than 10,000 IU/ day; in a clinical trial in healthy adults, the daily dose was 4,000 IU.
Vitamin D3 not associated with hypercalciuria or hypercalcaemia for up to 5 months.
ADROVANCE is a combination tablet containing the two active ingredients sodium alendronate 3 H2O and colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Alendronate Sodium alendronate 3 H2O is a bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts without exerting a direct effect on bone formation.
Preclinic studies have shown that alendronate concentrates preferably at sites of active absorption.
Osteoclastic activity is inhibited, but osteoclastic recruiting and binding are not affected.
The bone formed during therapy with alendronate is of normal quality.
Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3.
In case of inadequate exposure to the sun, it is essential that vitamin D3 is included in the diet.
Vitamin D3 is converted by the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and stored until it is needed.
Renal conversion to the active calcium mobilising hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) is strictly regulated.
The main effect of 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and to regulate serum calcium, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone absorption.
Vitamin D3 is required for normal bone formation.
Vitamin D deficiency occurs when insufficient exposure to the sun and intake from food occurs.
Deficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, bone loss and an increased risk of skeletal fractures.
In severe cases, deficiency may lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphataemia, proximal muscle weakness, osteomalacia, and a further increased risk of falls and bone fractures in osteoporotic patients.
Vitamin D supplementation reduces these risks and their consequences.
bone mineral density) in the spine or hip, which is 2.5 standard deviations below the mean for a normal, young population, or regardless of bone density as the underlying pathological fracture.
Trials of ADROVANCE The effect of the lower dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronate/ 2,800 IU vitamin D3) on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15-week, multi-national trial in 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis (mean serum baseline of 25-hydroxyvitamin D: 56 nmol/ l <unk> 22.3 ng/ ml <unk>; range: 22.5 225 nmol/ l <unk> 9-90 ng/ ml <unk>).
Patients received lower strength ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n/ 350) or FOSAMAX (alendronate) 70 mg once weekly (n/ 332) with no other vitamin D supplements.
After 15 weeks of treatment, mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher (26%) in the ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (56 nmol/ l <unk> 23 ng/ ml <unk> group than in the alendronate group alone (46 nmol/ l <unk> 18.2 ng/ ml <unk>).
ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <unk> 37.5 nmol/ l <unk> 15 ng/ ml <unk>) by 62.5% after 15 weeks compared to alendronate alone (12% vs. 37.5 ng/ l <unk> 15 ng/ ml <unk>).
32%).
ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <unk> 22.5 nmol/ l <unk> 9 ng/ ml <unk>) by 92% compared to alendronate alone (1% vs. 13%).
In this study, mean serum values of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in patients with vitamin D insufficiency increased after 15 weeks at the start of the study (25-hydroxyvitamin D 22.5 to 37.5 nmol/ l <unk> 9 - <unk> 15 ng/ ml <unk>) from 30 nmol/ l (12.1 ng/ ml) to 40 nmol/ l (15.9 ng/ ml) in the group on ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n<unk> 75) and decreased from 30 nmol/ l (12.0 ng/ ml) at the start of the study to 26 nmol/ l (10.4 ng/ ml) in the group on alendronate alone (n<unk> 70).
There were no differences between treatment groups regarding the mean values of serum calcium, phosphate or calcium in 24 hour urine.
The effect of the lower dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronate/ 2,800 IU of vitamin D3) with an additional dose of 2,800 IU of vitamin D3, for a total of 5,600 IU.
vitamin D3 (the amount of vitamin D3 in the higher dose of ADROVANCE) once a week was shown in a 24-week extension study in 619 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.
Patients in the 2,800 IU vitamin D3 group received ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n/ 299) and patients in the 5,600 IU vitamin D3 group received ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) and an additional 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 (n/ 309) once a week; additional vitamin D supplements were allowed; after 24 weeks of treatment, mean serum levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher in the 5,600 IU vitamin D3 group (69 nmol/ 27.6 ng/ ml) than in the 2,800 IU vitamin D3 group (64 nmol/ 25.5 ng/ ml).
The proportion of vitamin D deficient patients during the 24 week extension study was 5.4% in the 2.800 IU vitamin D 3 group vs. 5.8% in the placebo group.
The proportion of patients with pre-existing major macrovascular disease was 3.2% in the 5,600 IU vitamin D3 group.
Vitamin D deficiency was 0.3% in the 2.800 IU vitamin D3 group vs. 0% in the 5.600 IU vitamin D3 group.
There were no differences between treatment groups regarding the mean values of serum calcium, phosphate or calcium in 24 hour urine.
There was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups in the proportion of patients with hypercalciuria at the end of the 24 week extension.
Trials of alendronate The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate 70 mg (n<unk> 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n<unk> 370) was demonstrated in a one-year, multi-centre study in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.
Increases above baseline lumbar spine BMD after one year were on average 5.1% (95% CI:
4.8, 5.4%) in the 70 mg weekly and 5.4% weekly (95% CI:
5.0, 5.8%) in the 10 mg daily group.
The mean increases in BMD were 2.3% and 2.9% for the femoral neck and 2.9% and 3.1% for the total hip, respectively, in the 70 mg weekly and 10 mg daily group.
The two treatment groups were also comparable in BMD increases at other skeletal sites.
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were examined in two phase II studies of identical design (n<unk> 944) and in the Fracture Intervention Study (FIT: n<unk> 6,459).
In the phase II trials, mean increases in BMD with alendronate 10 mg/ day in relation to placebo at 3 years were 8.8% at the spine, 5.9% at the femoral neck and 7.8% at the trochanter.
The BMD of the total keleton was also significantly increased.
In the alendronate treated group, a 48% reduction was achieved (alendronate 3.2% vs. placebo 6.2%) in the proportion of patients who sustained one or more vertebral fractures compared to the placebo group.
For the two year extension of these studies, the increases in BMD of the spine and trochanter continued and BMD of the femoral neck and of the entire body was also sustained.
FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled studies in which alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and thereafter 10 mg daily for either 1 or 2 years):
FIT 1: a three year trial involving 2,027 patients with at least one pre-existing spine / compression / fracture.
In this study, daily administration of alendronate reduced the incidence of at least one new vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% vs. placebo 15.0%).
In addition, a significant reduction in the incidence of hip fractures was observed (1.1% vs. 2.2%; 51% reduction).
FIT 2: a four year study in 4,432 patients with low bone mass but no pre-existing vertebral fracture.
This study found a significant difference in the incidence of hip fractures (alendronate 1.0% vs. placebo 2.2%; reduction 56%) and of at least one vertebral fracture (2.9% vs. 5.8%; reduction by 50%) in the analysis of the subgroup of osteoporotic women (37% of the total number who suffered from osteoporosis as defined above).
Absorption At a reference intravenous dose, the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nocturnal fasting and two hours prior to eating a standardized breakfast.
Bioavailability decreased correspondingly to approximately 0.46% and 0.39%, when alendronate was administered one or half hour prior to a standardized breakfast.
In osteoporosis studies, alendronate was effective when taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.
The alendronate constituents of the ADROVANCE combination tablet (70 mg/ 5,600 IU) and a tablet of 70 mg alendronate are bioequivalent.
Bioavailability was minimal when alendronate was administered with or up to two hours after a standardized breakfast.
Alendronate concomitant administration of coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60%.
In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg 3 times daily for five days) did not cause clinically important changes in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (mean increase was 20% to 44%).
Distribution Studies in rats have shown that alendronate, administered intravenously (1 mg/ kg), temporarily spreads into soft tissue but then rapidly redistributes to bone or is excreted in the urine.
The mean steady state volume of distribution in man, except for bone, is at least 28 litres.
Plasma concentrations after intake of oral therapeutic doses of alendronate are too low for analytical detection (<unk> 5 ng/ ml).
The protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78%.
Biotransformation There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolised in animals or humans.
Excretion Following a single intravenous dose of 14C-alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactively labelled substance was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was recovered in the faeces.
Following a single intravenous dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml/ min and the systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml/ min.
Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95% within six hours after intravenous administration.
The terminal half-life in humans is estimated to be greater than ten years when factoring in the release of alendronate from the skeleton.
Alendronate is not excreted in rats by the acidic or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the excretion of other medicinal products by these transport systems in humans.
Absorption In healthy adult subjects (women and men), ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 5,600 IU) was administered after nocturnal fasting and two hours before meals, the mean surface area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC0-80 h) for vitamin D3 was 490.2 ng h/ ml (excluding endogenous vitamin D3 levels).
The mean maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of vitamin D3 was 12.2 ng/ ml and the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (Tmax) was 10.6 hours.
The bioavailability of 5,600 IU of vitamin D3 in ADROVANCE is comparable to that of 5,600 IU of vitamin D3 taken on its own.
Distribution After absorption, vitamin D3 is absorbed by the blood as a component of chylomicrons.
Vitamin D3 is rapidly distributed, primarily to the liver, where it is metabolised into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the main storage.
Smaller amounts are distributed in fat and muscle tissue, where they are stored as vitamin D3 to be later released into the circulation.
Circulating vitamin D3 is bound to vitamin D-binding protein.
Vitamin D3 is rapidly hydroxylated by the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and then metabolised by the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the biologically active form.
Further hydroxylation occurs prior to excretion.
A small fraction of vitamin D3 is glucuronised before excretion.
Excretion Mean excretion of radioactivity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4% for healthy subjects and 4.9% for faeces after 4 days when radioactively labelled vitamin D3 was administered.
In both cases, radioactivity was excreted almost exclusively as metabolites of the starting substance.
The mean half-life of vitamin D3 in the serum is approximately 24 hours after an oral dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU).
Characteristics in patients Preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate not deposited in the bone is rapidly excreted in the urine.
No evidence of saturation of the bone absorption capacity at long doses of cumulative intravenous doses up to 35 mg/ kg was found in animals.
Although no clinical data are available, renal elimination of alendronate, as seen in animal studies, may be expected to be reduced even in patients with renal impairment.
Therefore, a somewhat increased accumulation of alendronate in bone may be expected in patients with impaired renal function (see section 4.2).
Non-clinical trials of the combination of alendronate and colecalciferol have not been performed.
Non-clinical data based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, chronic toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, reveal no special hazard for humans.
Studies in rats showed that administration of alendronate to pregnant rats was associated with the onset of dystocia in the dam due to hypocalcaemia.
In studies, high doses in rats increased the incidence of incomplete ossification in the foetus.
The significance of this observation for humans is unknown.
Colecalciferol In animal studies, reproductive toxicity was observed at doses much higher than the human therapeutic dose.

Das vorliegende Dokument ist eine Zusammenfassung des Europäischen Öffentlichen Beurteilungsberichts (EPAR), in dem erläutert wird, wie der Ausschuss für Humanarzneimittel (CHMP) die durchgeführten Studien beurteilt hat, um zu Empfehlungen bezüglich der Anwendung des Arzneimittels zu gelangen. It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
Advate consists of a powder and a solvent mixed to make a solution for injection.
Advate contains the active substance octocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII).
Advate is used to treat and prevent haemorrhage in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).
Advate is indicated for both short- and long-term use.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
Treatment with Advate should be initiated by a physician with experience in the treatment of haemophilia.
Advate is administered by injection into a vein at a rate of up to 10 ml per minute.
The dosage and frequency of administration will depend on whether Advate is used to treat haemorrhage or to prevent haemorrhage during surgery.
Moreover, the dosage is adjusted according to the degree of seriousness of the haemorrhage and the type of surgery.
Detailed information on the calculation of doses is available in the Package Leaflet.
The active substance in Advate, Octocog alfa, is a protein of the blood clotting factor.
Factor VIII is one of the substances (factors) in the body involved in blood clotting.
Patients with haemophilia A suffer from Factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.
Advate is used to replace the missing factor VIII.
It corrects factor VIII deficiency and enables temporary control of bleeding disorder.
Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced using a method termed recombinant DNA technology:
It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) has been introduced that enables it to form the human clotting factor VIII.

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged.
Therefore, in a main study in 111 patients who suffer from haemophilia A, Advate was compared to Recombinate to show that both medicines are equivalent; the study also looked at the number of episodes of bleeding in 107 patients who received all of Advate, and assessed the effectiveness of Advate in haemostasis on a scale from ineffective to excellent; and in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study in 53 children under six years of age, the use of the medicine to prevent haemorrhage and for surgery was examined.
What benefit has Advate shown during the studies?
In the main study, out of 510 new haemorrhage episodes, 86% of Advate s efficacy in preventing haemorrhage was rated excellent or good.
Moreover, in 81% of these bleeding episodes, only one treatment of Advate was required.
The additional studies, including the study in children under six years of age, confirmed the effectiveness of Advate.
Patients with haemophilia A may develop antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII.
An antibody is a protein formed by the body in response to unknown substances by its natural protective mechanism.
If antibodies develop, the effectiveness of Advate is not assured.
The most frequent side effects with Advate (seen in 1 to 10 patients in 100) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII.
Hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) has been observed in some patients treated with medicines containing factor VIII.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Advate, see the Package Leaflet.
Do not use Advate in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the excipients.
Der Ausschuss für Humanarzneimittel (CHMP) gelangte zu zu Schluss, dass die Vorteile von Advate bei der Behandlung und Propyhlaxe von Blutungen bei Patienten mit Hämophilie A (innate Mangel an Factor VIII) gegenüber den Risiken überwiegen, und empfahl, die Genehmigung für das Inverkehrbringen von Advate zu erteilen. The Committee recommended that Advate be given marketing authorisation.
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Advate to Baxter AG on 2 March 2004.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 2 March 2009.
The full EPAR for Advate is available here.
Powder: Vial (glass) Solvent: vial (glass)
1 vial + 1 vial + reconstitution unit
ADVATE 250 IU powder and solvents for the preparation of a solution for injection
Each bottle contains a nominal 250 IU/ recombinant blood clotting factor VIII (rDNA) octocog alfa/ *.
After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains approximately 50 IU/ ml of octocog alfa.
Activity (International Units) is determined using the chromogenic assay against an in house standard related to the WHO standard, the specific activity is approximately 4000 10,000 IU/ mg protein <unk> blood clotting factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology in the ovarian cells of the Chinese hamster (CHO).
Prepared without the addition of any (exogenous) human or animal protein during the cell culture, purification and final formulation process.
0.45 mmol sodium chloride (10 mg) per vial.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free of foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3.
Treatment and prophylaxis of haemorrhage in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen s syndrome.
Treatment should be given under the supervision of a physician familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage Dosage and duration of substitution therapy are dependent on the seriousness of the factor VIII deficiency, on the site and extent of the haemorrhage and on the patient s clinical condition.
Treatment on demand The Factor VIII dose is presented in International Units (IU) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is presented either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
1 One IU of factor VIII activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
Calculation of the necessary Factor VIII dose is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU.
Factor VIII per kg bodyweight increases factor VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII-increase (%) x 0.5
In the case of subsequent haemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the stated plasma concentrations (in% of the norm or in IU/ dl) over the corresponding period.
The following table 1 provides guidance on dosage for haemorrhage and surgery:
Table 1: Dosage guidance for haemorrhage events and operations Haemorrhage grade / type of surgery Haemorrhage
Necessary factor VIII plasma level (% or IU/ dl)
Dosage frequency (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
Early joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or mouth haemorrhage.
Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until the bleeding is stopped due to pain or healing.
More pronounced joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or haematoma.
Repeat the injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for 3-4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are removed.
Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until the risk to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
Injection should be repeated every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity at 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted in accordance with the clinical efficacy of the product on a case by case basis.
In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titre) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
Adequate determination of Factor VIII plasma concentrations is recommended throughout the course of therapy in order to control the dose and frequency of injections.
Close monitoring of substitution therapy by measurement of factor VIII activity in plasma is essential, especially in major surgery.
Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, may achieve different in vivo recovery goals and may have different half-lives.
3 Prophylaxis For the long term prophylaxis of haemorrhage in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of factor VIII per kg bodyweight should be given at intervals of 2 3 days between 20 and 40 IU.
In patients under 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 3 4 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored regularly for the formation of inhibitors of factor VIII.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test should be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high levels of inhibitors, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures may have to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in the treatment of patients with haemophilia.
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is required prior to administration.
The rate of administration should be determined by the condition of the patient, with a maximum rate of injection not exceeding 10 ml/ min.
For the benefit of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, the name and batch number of the product should be noted.
For information on reconstitution prior to administration, see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
The patients should be informed about the signs of an immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory symptoms (e. g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms appear, patients should discontinue treatment immediately and contact their physician.
In the event of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be conducted in accordance with the current medical standard (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are invariably directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, quantified in Bethesda units (BU) per ml of plasma using a modified Bethesda assay.
In patients developing inhibitors of factor VIII, this may result in insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, contact with a haemophilia centre is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the highest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and being dependent on genetic and other factors.
On rare occasions, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 days of exposure and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (low-titre) inhibitors was observed after transfer from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
After reconstitution, this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
This must be taken into account in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No studies on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been performed.
Animal reproductive studies have not been performed with factor VIII.
There is no experience in the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding because of the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women.
Therefore, in pregnancy and breast-feeding women, factor VIII should only be used when the indication is clear.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
As with any intravenous protein, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions may occur (see section 4.4).
During clinical trials of ADVATE, a total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 out of 234 once treated patients.
The ADRs that occurred in the largest number of patients were inhibitors of factor VIII (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who were at greater risk of forming inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Of the total of 56 undesirable effects, none were observed in newborns, 16 were reported in 13/ 32 infants, 7 in 4/ 56 children, 8 in 4/ 31 adolescents, and 25 in 14/ 94 adults 1.
Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: Very common (1/ 10), Common (1/ 100 to 1/ 10), Uncommon (1/ 1,000 to 1/ 100), Rare (1/ 10,000 to 1/ 1,000), Very rare (1/ 10,000), Unknown (Frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).
Within frequencies, undesirable effects are listed in order of decreasing seriousness.

Injury, poisoning and procedures
a) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). b) The unexpected fall in blood clotting factor VIII occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient receiving continuous infusion of ADVATE.
Blood clotting was sustained throughout and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to satisfactory levels on the 15th day after surgery.
At the end of the continuous infusion period, tests for factor VIII inhibitors were performed and were negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor development Neoantigenicity of ADVATE has been evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient demonstrated a low inhibitor titre (2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
Moreover, none of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) was identified as having an FVIII inhibitor after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors of factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titre (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titre (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The current detection frequency of FVIII inhibitors is in line with expectations and is in the range already observed.
The patient immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 showed a statistically significant uptick in titers in linear regression analysis, and 4 of these patients had sustained peaks or transient spikes.
A patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise there was no evidence or symptom indicating allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend of titers in linear regression analysis and 2 of the patients had a sustained peak or transient peak.
A patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to murine IgG.
In four patients, isolated reports of urticaria, pruritus, skin rash and increased eosinophilic granulocyte count were reported during multiple repeated product exposures during the study.
As for other intravenous products, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency not known) have been reported with ADVATE.
Symptoms of overdose with recombinant blood clotting factor VIII in humans are not known.
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
The factor VIII/ of Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and of Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant blood clotting factor VIII (Octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to the glycoprotein that occurs in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of about 280 kD.
When octocog alfa is injected into a patient with haemophilia A, the patient s blood stream binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor.
The activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clotting can occur.
Haemophilia A is a gender related, hereditary blood clotting disorder caused by decreased Factor VIII levels.
This leads to severe bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a consequence of accidental or surgical trauma.
Factor VIII plasma concentrations are increased by substitution therapy, resulting in temporary correction of factor VIII deficiency and haemorrhage.
All pharmacokinetic trials of ADVATE were conducted in pre-treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline of factor VIII activity 2%).
Evaluation of plasma samples was performed in a central laboratory using a single-stage clotting test.
The pharmacokinetic parameters are from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or <unk> 10 years, listed in Table 3 below.

The recovery and measured half-life in infants (less than 6 years) was approximately 20% lower than in adults, which may be due to the higher plasma volume per kg bodyweight in younger patients.
There are no pharmacokinetic data on the use of ADVATE in previously untreated patients.
Non-clinical data based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute, repeated and local toxicity, genotoxicity, show no special risk for humans.

Do not remove the blue protective cap from the BAXJECT II.
Use only the enclosed water for injections and the enclosed reconstitution set to disperse.
Turn the system consisting of the BAXJECT II and the solvent vial over so that the solvent vial is on top.
Push the white mandrel of the BAXJECT II through the rubber stopper of the ADVATE bottle.
The solvent is drawn into the ADVATE bottle through the vacuum (Fig. C).
Make sure that ADVATE is completely solved, otherwise the entire reconstituted solution will not be pushed through the filter in BAXJECT II.
Product disperses rapidly (usually in less than 1 minute).
After reconstitution, the solution should be clear, colourless and free of foreign particles.
If the solution and containers allow it, parenterals should always be checked for suspended particles before administration.
Use only clear, colourless solutions.
Connect the syringe to the BAXJECT II (Fig. d).
Turn the system upwards (with the concentrate vial facing up).
Pull the reconstituted solution into the syringe by slowly pulling the plunger back (Fig. e).
Connect the perfusion set to the syringe and intravenously inject the product.
The solution should be administered slowly at a pace that is convenient for the patient and does not exceed 10 ml/ minute.
The patient s pulse should be measured before and during administration of ADVATE.
A significant increase in the pulse rate can usually be reduced immediately by slowing down or interrupting the injection (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

ADVATE 500 IU powder and solvents for the preparation of a solution for injection
Each bottle contains a nominal 500 IU/ recombinant blood clotting factor VIII (rDNA) octocog alfa/ *.
After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains approximately 100 IU/ ml of octocog alfa.
Activity (International Units) is determined using the chromogenic assay against an in house standard related to the WHO standard, the specific activity is approximately 4000 10,000 IU/ mg protein <unk> blood clotting factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology in the ovarian cells of the Chinese hamster (CHO).
Prepared without the addition of any (exogenous) human or animal protein during the cell culture, purification and final formulation process.
0.45 mmol sodium chloride (10 mg) per vial.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free of foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3.
Treatment and prophylaxis of haemorrhage in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen s syndrome.
Treatment should be given under the supervision of a physician familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage Dosage and duration of substitution therapy are dependent on the seriousness of the factor VIII deficiency, on the site and extent of the haemorrhage and on the patient s clinical condition.
Treatment on demand The Factor VIII dose is presented in International Units (IU) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is presented either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
One IU of factor VIII activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
Calculation of the required Factor VIII dose is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU of Factor VIII per kg bodyweight increases Factor VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII-increase (%) x 0.5
In the case of subsequent haemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the stated plasma concentrations (in% of the norm or in IU/ dl) over the corresponding period.
The following table 1 provides guidance on dosage for haemorrhage and surgery:
Table 1: Dosage guidance for haemorrhage events and operations Haemorrhage grade / type of surgery Haemorrhage
Necessary factor VIII plasma level (% or IU/ dl)
Dosage frequency (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
Early joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or mouth haemorrhage.
Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until the bleeding is stopped due to pain or healing.
More pronounced joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or haematoma.
Repeat the injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for 3-4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are removed.
Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until the risk to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
Injection should be repeated every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity at 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted in accordance with the clinical efficacy of the product on a case by case basis.
In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titre) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
Adequate determination of Factor VIII plasma concentrations is recommended throughout the course of therapy in order to control the dose and frequency of injections.
Close monitoring of substitution therapy by measurement of factor VIII activity in plasma is essential, especially in major surgery.
Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, may achieve different in vivo recovery goals and may have different half-lives.
14 Prophylaxis For the long term prophylaxis of haemorrhage in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of factor VIII per kg bodyweight should be given at intervals of 2 3 days between 20 and 40 IU.
In patients under 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 3 4 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored regularly for the formation of inhibitors of factor VIII.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test should be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high levels of inhibitors, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures may have to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in the treatment of patients with haemophilia.
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is required prior to administration.
The rate of administration should be determined by the condition of the patient, with a maximum rate of injection not exceeding 10 ml/ min.
For the benefit of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, the name and batch number of the product should be noted.
For information on reconstitution prior to administration, see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
The patients should be informed about the signs of an immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory symptoms (e. g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms appear, patients should discontinue treatment immediately and contact their physician.
In the event of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be conducted in accordance with the current medical standard (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are invariably directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, quantified in Bethesda units (BU) per ml of plasma using a modified Bethesda assay.
In patients developing inhibitors of factor VIII, this may result in insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, contact with a haemophilia centre is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the highest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and being dependent on genetic and other factors.
On rare occasions, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 days of exposure and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (low-titre) inhibitors was observed after transfer from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
After reconstitution, this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
This must be taken into account in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No studies on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been performed.
Animal reproductive studies have not been performed with factor VIII.
There is no experience in the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding because of the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women.
Therefore, in pregnancy and breast-feeding women, factor VIII should only be used when the indication is clear.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
As with any intravenous protein, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions may occur (see section 4.4).
During clinical trials of ADVATE, a total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 out of 234 once treated patients.
The ADRs that occurred in the largest number of patients were inhibitors of factor VIII (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who were at greater risk of forming inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Of the total of 56 undesirable effects, none were observed in newborns; 16 were reported in 13/ 32 infants, 7 in 4/ 56 children, 8 in 4/ 31 adolescents, and 25 in 14/ 94 adults.
Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: Very common (1/ 10), Common (1/ 100 to 1/ 10), Uncommon (1/ 1,000 to 1/ 100), Rare (1/ 10,000 to 1/ 1,000), Very rare (1/ 10,000), Unknown (Frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).
Within frequencies, undesirable effects are listed in order of decreasing seriousness.
The following table 2 shows the frequency of undesirable effects in clinical trials:

a) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). b) The unexpected fall in blood clotting factor VIII occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient receiving continuous infusion of ADVATE.
Blood clotting was sustained throughout and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to satisfactory levels on the 15th day after surgery.
At the end of the continuous infusion period, tests for factor VIII inhibitors were performed and were negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor development Neoantigenicity of ADVATE has been evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient demonstrated a low inhibitor titre (2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
Moreover, none of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) was identified as having an FVIII inhibitor after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors of factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titre (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titre (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The current detection frequency of FVIII inhibitors is in line with expectations and is in the range already observed.
The patient immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 showed a statistically significant uptick in titers in linear regression analysis, and 4 of these patients had sustained peaks or transient spikes.
A patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise there was no evidence or symptom indicating allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend of titers in linear regression analysis and 2 of the patients had a sustained peak or transient peak.
A patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to murine IgG.
In four patients, isolated reports of urticaria, pruritus, skin rash and increased eosinophilic granulocyte count were reported during multiple repeated product exposures during the study.
As for other intravenous products, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency not known) have been reported with ADVATE.
Symptoms of overdose with recombinant blood clotting factor VIII in humans are not known.
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
The factor VIII/ of Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and of Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions.
ADVATE contains recombinant blood clotting factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to the glycoprotein that occurs in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of about 280 kD.
When octocog alfa is injected into a patient with haemophilia A, the patient s blood stream binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor.
The activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clotting can occur.
Haemophilia A is a gender related, hereditary blood clotting disorder caused by decreased Factor VIII levels.
This leads to severe bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a consequence of accidental or surgical trauma.
Factor VIII plasma concentrations are increased by substitution therapy, resulting in temporary correction of factor VIII deficiency and haemorrhage.
All pharmacokinetic trials of ADVATE were conducted in pre-treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline of factor VIII activity 2%).
Evaluation of plasma samples was performed in a central laboratory using a single-stage clotting test.
The pharmacokinetic parameters are from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or <unk> 10 years, listed in Table 3 below.

The recovery and measured half-life in infants (less than 6 years) was approximately 20% lower than in adults, which may be due to the higher plasma volume per kg bodyweight in younger patients.
There are no pharmacokinetic data on the use of ADVATE in previously untreated patients.
Non-clinical data based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute, repeated and local toxicity, genotoxicity, show no special risk for humans.

One IU of factor VIII activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
Calculation of the required Factor VIII dose is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU of Factor VIII per kg bodyweight increases Factor VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII-increase (%) x 0.5
In the case of subsequent haemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the stated plasma concentrations (in% of the norm or in IU/ dl) over the corresponding period.
The following table 1 provides guidance on dosage for haemorrhage and surgery:

More pronounced joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or haematoma.
Repeat the injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for 3-4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are removed.
Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until the risk to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
Injection should be repeated every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity at 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted in accordance with the clinical efficacy of the product on a case by case basis.
In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titre) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
Adequate determination of Factor VIII plasma concentrations is recommended throughout the course of therapy in order to control the dose and frequency of injections.
Close monitoring of substitution therapy by measurement of factor VIII activity in plasma is essential, especially in major surgery.
Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, may achieve different in vivo recovery goals and may have different half-lives.
25 Prophylaxis For the long term prophylaxis of haemorrhage in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of factor VIII per kg bodyweight should be given at intervals of 2 3 days between 20 and 40 IU.
In patients under 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 3 4 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored regularly for the formation of inhibitors of factor VIII.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test should be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high levels of inhibitors, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures may have to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in the treatment of patients with haemophilia.
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is required prior to administration.
The rate of administration should be determined by the condition of the patient, with a maximum rate of injection not exceeding 10 ml/ min.
For the benefit of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, the name and batch number of the product should be noted.
For information on reconstitution prior to administration, see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
The patients should be informed about the signs of an immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory symptoms (e. g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms appear, patients should discontinue treatment immediately and contact their physician.
In the event of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be conducted in accordance with the current medical standard (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are invariably directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, quantified in Bethesda units (BU) per ml of plasma using a modified Bethesda assay.
In patients developing inhibitors of factor VIII, this may result in insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, contact with a haemophilia centre is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the highest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and being dependent on genetic and other factors.
On rare occasions, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 days of exposure and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (low-titre) inhibitors was observed after transfer from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
This medicinal product contains, after reconstitution, 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
This must be taken into account in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No studies on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been performed.
Animal reproductive studies have not been performed with factor VIII.
There is no experience in the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding because of the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women.
Therefore, in pregnancy and breast-feeding women, factor VIII should only be used when the indication is clear.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
As with any intravenous protein, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions may occur (see section 4.4).
During clinical trials of ADVATE, a total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 out of 234 once treated patients.
The ADRs that occurred in the largest number of patients were inhibitors of factor VIII (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who were at greater risk of forming inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Of the total of 56 undesirable effects, none were observed in newborns; 16 were reported in 13/ 32 infants, 7 in 4/ 56 children, 8 in 4/ 31 adolescents, and 25 in 14/ 94 adults.
Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: Very common (1/ 10), Common (1/ 100 to 1/ 10), Uncommon (1/ 1,000 to 1/ 100), Rare (1/ 10,000 to 1/ 1,000), Very rare (1/ 10,000), Unknown (Frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).

Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
Moreover, none of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) was identified as having an FVIII inhibitor after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors of factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titre (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titre (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The current detection frequency of FVIII inhibitors is in line with expectations and is in the range already observed.

In four patients, isolated reports of urticaria, pruritus, skin rash and increased eosinophilic granulocyte count were reported during multiple repeated product exposures during the study.
As for other intravenous products, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency not known) have been reported with ADVATE.
Symptoms of overdose with recombinant blood clotting factor VIII in humans are not known.
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
The factor VIII/ of Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and of Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions.
ADVATE contains recombinant blood clotting factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to the glycoprotein that occurs in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of about 280 kD.
When octocog alfa is injected into a patient with haemophilia A, the patient s blood stream binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor.
The activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clotting can occur.
Haemophilia A is a gender related, hereditary blood clotting disorder caused by decreased Factor VIII levels.
This leads to severe bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a consequence of accidental or surgical trauma.
Factor VIII plasma concentrations are increased by substitution therapy, resulting in temporary correction of factor VIII deficiency and haemorrhage.
All pharmacokinetic trials of ADVATE were conducted in pre-treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline of factor VIII activity 2%).
Evaluation of plasma samples was performed in a central laboratory using a single-stage clotting test.
The pharmacokinetic parameters are from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or <unk> 10 years, listed in Table 3 below.

The recovery and measured half-life in infants (less than 6 years) was approximately 20% lower than in adults, which may be due to the higher plasma volume per kg bodyweight in younger patients.
There are no pharmacokinetic data on the use of ADVATE in previously untreated patients.
Non-clinical data based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute, repeated and local toxicity, genotoxicity, show no special risk for humans.

ADVATE 1500 IU powder and solvents for the preparation of a solution for injection
Each bottle contains a nominal 1500 IU/ recombinant blood clotting factor VIII (rDNA) octocog alfa/ *.
After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains approximately 300 IU/ ml of octocog alfa.
Activity (International Units) is determined using the chromogenic assay against an in house standard related to the WHO standard, the specific activity is approximately 4000 10,000 IU/ mg protein <unk> blood clotting factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology in the ovarian cells of the Chinese hamster (CHO).
Prepared without the addition of any (exogenous) human or animal protein during the cell culture, purification and final formulation process.
0.45 mmol sodium chloride (10 mg) per vial.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free of foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3.
Treatment and prophylaxis of haemorrhage in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen s syndrome.
Treatment should be given under the supervision of a physician familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage Dosage and duration of substitution therapy are dependent on the seriousness of the factor VIII deficiency, on the site and extent of the haemorrhage and on the patient s clinical condition.
Treatment on demand The Factor VIII dose is presented in International Units (IU) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is presented either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
35 IU of factor VIII activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in a ml of normal human plasma.
Calculation of the required Factor VIII dose is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU of Factor VIII per kg bodyweight increases Factor VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII-increase (%) x 0.5
In the case of subsequent haemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the stated plasma concentrations (in% of the norm or in IU/ dl) over the corresponding period.
The following table 1 provides guidance on dosage for haemorrhage and surgery:
Table 1: Dosage guidance for haemorrhage events and operations Haemorrhage grade / type of surgery Haemorrhage
Necessary factor VIII plasma level (% or IU/ dl)
Dosage frequency (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
Early joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or mouth haemorrhage.
Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until the bleeding is stopped due to pain or healing.
More pronounced joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or haematoma.
Repeat the injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for 3-4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are removed.
Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until the risk to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
Injection should be repeated every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity at 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted in accordance with the clinical efficacy of the product on a case by case basis.
In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titre) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
Adequate determination of Factor VIII plasma concentrations is recommended throughout the course of therapy in order to control the dose and frequency of injections.
Close monitoring of substitution therapy by measurement of factor VIII activity in plasma is essential, especially in major surgery.
Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, may achieve different in vivo recovery goals and may have different half-lives.
36 Prophylaxis For the long term prophylaxis of haemorrhage in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of factor VIII per kg bodyweight should be given at intervals of 2 3 days between 20 and 40 IU.
In patients under 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 3 4 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored regularly for the formation of inhibitors of factor VIII.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test should be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high levels of inhibitors, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures may have to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in the treatment of patients with haemophilia.
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is required prior to administration.
The rate of administration should be determined by the condition of the patient, with a maximum rate of injection not exceeding 10 ml/ min.
For the benefit of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, the name and batch number of the product should be noted.
For information on reconstitution prior to administration, see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
The patients should be informed about the signs of an immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory symptoms (e. g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms appear, patients should discontinue treatment immediately and contact their physician.
In the event of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be conducted in accordance with the current medical standard (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are invariably directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, quantified in Bethesda units (BU) per ml of plasma using a modified Bethesda assay.
In patients developing inhibitors of factor VIII, this may result in insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, contact with a haemophilia centre is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the highest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and being dependent on genetic and other factors.
On rare occasions, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 days of exposure and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (low-titre) inhibitors was observed after transfer from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
After reconstitution, this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
This must be taken into account in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No studies on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been performed.
Animal reproductive studies have not been performed with factor VIII.
There is no experience in the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding because of the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women.
Therefore, in pregnancy and breast-feeding women, factor VIII should only be used when the indication is clear.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
As with any intravenous protein, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions may occur (see section 4.4).
During clinical trials of ADVATE, a total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 out of 234 once treated patients.
The ADRs that occurred in the largest number of patients were inhibitors of factor VIII (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who were at greater risk of forming inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Of the total of 56 undesirable effects, none were observed in newborns; 16 were reported in 13/ 32 infants, 7 in 4/ 56 children, 8 in 4/ 31 adolescents, and 25 in 14/ 94 adults.
Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: Very common (1/ 10), Common (1/ 100 to 1/ 10), Uncommon (1/ 1,000 to 1/ 100), Rare (1/ 10,000 to 1/ 1,000), Very rare (1/ 10,000), Unknown (Frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).
Within frequencies, undesirable effects are listed in order of decreasing seriousness.
The following table 2 shows the frequency of undesirable effects in clinical trials:
Table 2 Frequency of adverse reactions (ADRs) in clinical trials

a) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). b) The unexpected fall in blood clotting factor VIII occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient receiving continuous infusion of ADVATE.
Blood clotting was sustained throughout and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to satisfactory levels on the 15th day after surgery.
At the end of the continuous infusion period, tests for factor VIII inhibitors were performed and were negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor development Neoantigenicity of ADVATE has been evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients, 8 with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient demonstrated a low inhibitor titre (2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
Moreover, none of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) was identified as having an FVIII inhibitor after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors of factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titre (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titre (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The current detection frequency of FVIII inhibitors is in line with expectations and is in the range already observed.
The patient immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 showed a statistically significant uptick in titers in linear regression analysis, and 4 of these patients had sustained peaks or transient spikes.
A patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise there was no evidence or symptom indicating allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend of titers in linear regression analysis and 2 of the patients had a sustained peak or transient peak.
A patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to murine IgG.
In four patients, isolated reports of urticaria, pruritus, skin rash and increased eosinophilic granulocyte count were reported during multiple repeated product exposures during the study.
As for other intravenous products, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency not known) have been reported with ADVATE.

Every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
Injection should be repeated every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity at 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted in accordance with the clinical efficacy of the product on a case by case basis.
In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titre) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.

47 Prophylaxis For the long term prophylaxis of haemorrhage in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of factor VIII per kg bodyweight should be given at intervals of 2 3 days between 20 and 40 IU.
In patients under 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 3 4 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored regularly for the formation of inhibitors of factor VIII.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test should be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.

All patients treated with clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
This medicinal product contains, after reconstitution, 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
This must be taken into account in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No studies on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been performed.
Animal reproductive studies have not been performed with factor VIII.
There is no experience in the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding because of the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women.
Therefore, in pregnancy and breast-feeding women, factor VIII should only be used when the indication is clear.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
As with any intravenous protein, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions may occur (see section 4.4).
During clinical trials of ADVATE, a total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 out of 234 once treated patients.
The ADRs that occurred in the largest number of patients were inhibitors of factor VIII (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who were at greater risk of forming inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Of the total of 56 undesirable effects, none were observed in newborns; 16 were reported in 13/ 32 infants, 7 in 4/ 56 children, 8 in 4/ 31 adolescents, and 25 in 14/ 94 adults.
Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: Very common (1/ 10), Common (1/ 100 to 1/ 10), Uncommon (1/ 1,000 to 1/ 100), Rare (1/ 10,000 to 1/ 1,000), Very rare (1/ 10,000), Unknown (Frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).
Within frequencies, undesirable effects are listed in order of decreasing seriousness.
The following table 2 shows the frequency of undesirable effects in clinical trials:

a) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). b) The unexpected fall in blood clotting factor VIII occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient receiving continuous infusion of ADVATE.
Blood clotting was sustained throughout and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to satisfactory levels on the 15th day after surgery.
At the end of the continuous infusion period, tests for factor VIII inhibitors were performed and were negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor development Neoantigenicity of ADVATE has been evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients, 10 with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient demonstrated a low inhibitor titre (2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
Moreover, none of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) was identified as having an FVIII inhibitor after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors of factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titre (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titre (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The current detection frequency of FVIII inhibitors is in line with expectations and is in the range already observed.
The patient immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
Of the 182 treated patients tested for antibodies to CHO cell protein, 3 showed a statistically significant uptick in titers in linear regression analysis, and 4 of these patients had sustained peaks or transient spikes.
A patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise there was no evidence or symptom indicating allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.
Of the 182 treated subjects tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend of titers in linear regression analysis and 2 of the patients had a sustained peak or transient peak.
A patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to murine IgG.
In four patients, isolated reports of urticaria, pruritus, skin rash and increased eosinophilic granulocyte count were reported during multiple repeated product exposures during the study.
As for other intravenous products, ADVATE has been reported for allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency not known).
Symptoms of overdose with recombinant blood clotting factor VIII in humans are not known.
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
The factor VIII/ of Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and of Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions.
ADVATE contains recombinant blood clotting factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to the glycoprotein that occurs in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of about 280 kD.
When octocog alfa is injected into a patient with haemophilia A, the patient s blood stream binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor.
The activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clotting can occur.
Haemophilia A is a gender related, hereditary blood clotting disorder caused by decreased Factor VIII levels.
This leads to severe bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a consequence of accidental or surgical trauma.
Factor VIII plasma concentrations are increased by substitution therapy, resulting in temporary correction of factor VIII deficiency and haemorrhage.
All pharmacokinetic trials of ADVATE were conducted in pre-treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline of factor VIII activity 2%).
Evaluation of plasma samples was performed in a central laboratory using a single-stage clotting test.
The pharmacokinetic parameters are from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or <unk> 10 years, listed in Table 3 below.

The recovery and measured half-life in infants (less than 6 years) was approximately 20% lower than in adults, which may be due to the higher plasma volume per kg bodyweight in younger patients.
There are no pharmacokinetic data on the use of ADVATE in previously untreated patients.
Non-clinical data based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute, repeated and local toxicity, genotoxicity, show no special risk for humans.

its packaging is damaged or shows signs of manipulation.
When refrigerated, remove both vials of ADVATE powder and solvent from the refrigerator and allow to heat to room temperature (between 15 and 25<unk> C).
Wash hands carefully with soap and warm water.
Remove protective caps from vials with powder and solvents.
Place the vials on a level surface.
Open the package of the BAXJECT II by removing the protective foil without touching the contents of the package (Fig. A).
Do not take the transfer system out of the package
Do not use the BAXJECT II unit set if its sterile barrier is broken, its packaging is damaged or there are signs of manipulation.
Turn the opening downwards and push the transparent plastic mandrel through the rubber stopper on the solvent bottle.
Remove the package from the BAXJECT II (Fig. B).
Do not remove the blue protective cap from the BAXJECT II.
Use only the enclosed water for injections and the enclosed reconstitution set to disperse.
Turn the system consisting of the BAXJECT II and the solvent vial over so that the solvent vial is on top.
Push the white mandrel of the BAXJECT II through the rubber stopper of the ADVATE bottle.
The solvent is drawn into the ADVATE bottle through the vacuum (Fig. C).
Make sure that ADVATE is completely solved, otherwise the entire reconstituted solution will not be pushed through the filter in BAXJECT II.
Product disperses rapidly (usually in less than 1 minute).
After reconstitution, the solution should be clear, colourless and free of foreign particles.
If the solution and containers allow it, parenterals should always be checked for suspended particles before administration.
Use only clear, colourless solutions.
Connect the syringe to the BAXJECT II (Fig. d).
Turn the system upwards (with the concentrate vial facing up).
Pull the reconstituted solution into the syringe by slowly pulling the plunger back (Fig. e).
Connect the perfusion set to the syringe and intravenously inject the product.
The solution should be administered slowly at a pace that is convenient for the patient and does not exceed 10 ml/ minute.
The patient s pulse should be measured before and during administration of ADVATE.
A significant increase in the pulse rate can usually be reduced immediately by slowing down or interrupting the injection (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

ADVATE 3000 IU powder and solvents for the preparation of a solution for injection
Each bottle contains a nominal 3000 IU/ recombinant blood clotting factor VIII (rDNA) octocog alfa/ *.
After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains approximately 600 IU/ ml of octocog alfa.
Activity (International Units) is determined using the chromogenic assay against an in house standard related to the WHO standard, the specific activity is approximately 4000 10,000 IU/ mg protein <unk> blood clotting factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology in the ovarian cells of the Chinese hamster (CHO).
Prepared without the addition of any (exogenous) human or animal protein during the cell culture, purification and final formulation process.
0.45 mmol sodium chloride (10 mg) per vial.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free of foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3.
Treatment and prophylaxis of haemorrhage in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not suitable for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen s syndrome.
Treatment should be given under the supervision of a physician familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage Dosage and duration of substitution therapy are dependent on the seriousness of the factor VIII deficiency, on the site and extent of the haemorrhage and on the patient s clinical condition.
Treatment on demand The Factor VIII dose is presented in International Units (IU) in accordance with the WHO standard for Factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is presented either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
One IU of factor VIII activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
Calculation of the required Factor VIII dose is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU of Factor VIII per kg bodyweight increases Factor VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII-increase (%) x 0.5
In the case of subsequent haemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the stated plasma concentrations (in% of the norm or in IU/ dl) over the corresponding period.
The following table 1 provides guidance on dosage for haemorrhage and surgery:
Table 1: Dosage guidance for haemorrhage events and operations Haemorrhage grade / type of surgery Haemorrhage
Necessary factor VIII plasma level (% or IU/ dl)
Dosage frequency (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
Early joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or mouth haemorrhage.
Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until the bleeding is stopped due to pain or healing.
More pronounced joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or haematoma.
Repeat the injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years of age) for 3-4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are removed.
Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years of age) until the risk to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
Injection should be repeated every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours in patients under 6 years) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity at 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted in accordance with the clinical efficacy of the product on a case by case basis.
In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titre) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
Adequate determination of Factor VIII plasma concentrations is recommended throughout the course of therapy in order to control the dose and frequency of injections.
Close monitoring of substitution therapy by measurement of factor VIII activity in plasma is essential, especially in major surgery.
Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, may achieve different in vivo recovery goals and may have different half-lives.
58 Prophylaxis For the long term prophylaxis of haemorrhage in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of factor VIII per kg bodyweight should be given at intervals of 2 3 days between 20 and 40 IU.
In patients under 6 years of age, the administration of doses between 20 and 50 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 3 4 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored regularly for the formation of inhibitors of factor VIII.
If the expected Factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test should be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high levels of inhibitors, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures may have to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in the treatment of patients with haemophilia.
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate training is required prior to administration.
The rate of administration should be determined by the condition of the patient, with a maximum rate of injection not exceeding 10 ml/ min.
For the benefit of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, the name and batch number of the product should be noted.
For information on reconstitution prior to administration, see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
The patients should be informed about the signs of an immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory symptoms (e. g. tightness in the chest, wheezing).
If these symptoms appear, patients should discontinue treatment immediately and contact their physician.
In the event of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be conducted in accordance with the current medical standard (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are invariably directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, quantified in Bethesda units (BU) per ml of plasma using a modified Bethesda assay.
In patients developing inhibitors of factor VIII, this may result in insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, contact with a haemophilia centre is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the highest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and being dependent on genetic and other factors.
On rare occasions, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 days of exposure and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (low-titre) inhibitors was observed after transfer from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors. See section 4.8.
After reconstitution, this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
This must be taken into account in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No studies on the interaction of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been performed.
Animal reproductive studies have not been performed with factor VIII.
There is no experience in the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding because of the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women.
Therefore, in pregnancy and breast-feeding women, factor VIII should only be used when the indication is clear.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
As with any intravenous protein, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions may occur (see section 4.4).

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine.
- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor.
- This medicine has been prescribed for you.
It must not be passed on to third parties.
It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours.
- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet,
please tell your doctor if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet.
What ADVATE is and what it is used for 2.
Before you use ADVATE 3.
WHAT ADVATE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
As a medicinal product, ADVATE contains octocog alfa, the human blood clotting factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology.
Factor VIII is necessary to form clots in the blood in order to stop bleeding.
In patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) it is missing or not functioning properly.
ADVATE is used to prevent or treat spontaneous haemorrhage or haemorrhage following surgery in patients with haemophilia A.
ADVATE is produced without the addition of a human or animal protein during the cell culture, purification and final formulation process.
BEFORE YOU USE ADVATE
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to Octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients
- if you are allergic to mouse or hamster protein.
If in doubt, ask your doctor.
Take special care with ADVATE You should tell your doctor if you have been recently treated with Factor VIII products, especially if you have developed inhibitors.
Inhibitors are neutralising antibodies to factor VIII that reduce the effectiveness of ADVATE in preventing or controlling haemorrhage.
The development of inhibitors is a known complication of haemophilia A treatment.
If your bleeding cannot be controlled with ADVATE, contact your doctor immediately.
There is a small possibility that you may develop anaphylactic reaction (a sudden, severe, allergic reaction) to ADVATE.
You should be vigilant about early signs of such
These symptoms may be early signs of anaphylactic shock, which may also include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness and difficulties in breathing.
If any of these symptoms occurs, discontinue the injection immediately and contact your doctor.
Difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting may require immediate emergency treatment.
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.
Your doctor will decide whether you can use ADVATE in pregnancy and breast-feeding women.
Driving and using machines ADVATE has no effect on ability to drive and use machines.
Important information about some of the ingredients of ADVATE This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
This must be taken into account in patients on a sodium controlled diet.
Treatment with ADVATE is initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia A.
Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or IU) based on your physical condition and weight, and whether it is used to prevent or treat haemorrhage.
The frequency of doses depends on how well ADVATE works for you.
Normally, replacement therapy with ADVATE is given for life.
Prevention of bleeding The usual dose of Octocog alfa is 20 to 40 IU/ kg body weight, administered every 2 to 3 days.
In some cases, however, more frequent injections or higher doses may be required, especially in younger patients.
Treatment of haemorrhage The dose of octocog alfa is calculated in relation to body weight and desired factor VIII levels.
The required level of Factor VIII depends on the severity and site of the haemorrhage.
Weight (kg) x desired factor VIII-increase (% of normal) x 0.5
If you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, tell your doctor.
Your doctor will conduct appropriate laboratory tests at regular intervals to ensure that you have adequate Factor VIII levels.
This is especially important during major surgical procedures.
Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors If the expected factor VIII levels in your plasma are not achieved with ADVATE, or if haemorrhage cannot be controlled, this may be related to the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
This will be clarified by your doctor.
You may need higher doses of ADVATE or even another product to control the haemorrhage.
Increase the dosage of ADVATE to control your bleeding not without consulting your doctor.
HOW ADVATE is administered ADVATE is usually given by the physician into a vein (intravenously).
If you or someone else is administering ADVATE, this should only be done after adequate training.
Detailed information on self treatment is available at the end of the package leaflet.
If you take more ADVATE than you should Always use ADVATE exactly as your doctor has recommended.
Ask your doctor if you are not sure.
If you use more, ask your doctor as soon as possible.
If you forget to take ADVATE Do not inject twice the dose if you forget to take the previous dose.
Continue immediately with the next scheduled dose as instructed by your doctor.
If you discontinue the use of ADVATE, do not discontinue the use of ADVATE without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor.
Like all medicines, ADVATE can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
If sudden, severe (anaphylactic) side effects occur, the injection should be stopped immediately. You should contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early symptoms of allergic (hypersensitive) reactions:
- redness, rash, wheals, itching all over the body,
- Difficulty in breathing, whistling, tightness in the chest,
Severe side effects including difficulty breathing, and (near) fainting require immediate emergency treatment.

Questions and Answers on the withdrawal of the Marketing Authorisation Application for Advexin
International Freiname (INN): Contusugene Ladenovec
On 17 December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited officially told the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it was withdrawing its application for marketing authorisation for Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.
Advexin was designated an orphan medicinal product on 23 October 2006.
Advexin is a suspension for injection containing Contusugene Ladovec, a genetically modified virus carrying the p53 gene.
What should Advexin be used for?
Advexin should have been used to treat Li-Fraumeni cancer in patients from the age of 18 years.
Cancer of the liver is a type of cancer that occurs in patients with Li Fraumeni syndrome, where the so called p53 gene is defective due to a mutation and people with this mutation are more likely to develop cancer.
Cancer of the liver and liver can occur in many parts of the body.
However, this usually affects the chest, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body).
The active substance in Advexin, Contusugene Ladenovec, is a viral vector.
It is a type of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.
The virus in Advexin is an adenovirus that has been modified in such a way that it cannot make copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infection in humans.
The gene carrying the virus in Advexin is the normal (non-defective) p53 gene.
Advexin should have been injected directly into the tumours, enabling the cancer cells to reproduce the normal p53 protein.
The p53 protein, made up of the non-defective p53 gene present in the human body, usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to the killing of cells when DNA cannot be recovered.
Since cancer cells contain damaged DNA, the p53 protein helps to restore DNA or causes cells to die.
In Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly and cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.
Advexin should have cured the disease or slowed its progression by restoring the cells "normal protective function.
What documents has the company submitted to the CHMP in support of its application?
The effects of Advexin were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The company presented data from a study in a patient who had Li-Fraumeni cancer in the lower abdominal region, the bone and the brain.
The patient received 12 injections of Advexin, injected into some of the tumours, over a period of five months.

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged.
The company also presented results of several small studies looking at the effect of a dose range of Advexin on various cancers.
When the company withdrew its application, day 179 of the application procedure was reached.
After the CHMP reviewed the company s responses to the questions asked of it, some questions were still outstanding.
The CHMP usually takes up to 210 days to assess a new application.
Based on an examination of initial submissions, the CHMP will prepare a list of questions on day 120, which will be sent to the company.
Upon submission of responses, these questions will be reviewed by the CHMP.
Before the CHMP gives an opinion, it may ask the company any remaining questions on Day 180.
What was the CHMP recommendation at the time?
There were some concerns on the part of the CHMP at the time of the withdrawal because of the company s audited data and responses to the list of questions and the Committee took the preliminary view that Advexin could not have been approved for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.
What were the main concerns of the CHMP?
The CHMP considers that insufficient evidence exists that indicates that patients benefit from injection of Advexin into Li-Fraumeni tumours.
The Committee also had concerns about the way the product is processed in the body, the method of administration and the safety of the product.
Moreover, the company had not adequately demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment or to people who come into close contact with the patient.
On what grounds has the company withdrawn the application?
The letter informing the EMEA of the withdrawal of the application is available here.
What are the consequences of withdrawal for patients currently participating in clinical trials or Compassion Use programmes with Advexin?
The company did not notify the CHMP of the consequences of the withdrawal for patients currently participating in clinical trials or Compassion Use programmes with Advexin.

Aerinaze is a medicine containing the active ingredients desloratadine (2.5 mg) and pseudoephedrine (120 mg).
It is supplied as blue and white altered agent release tablets, which means that the tablets are made up so that one of the active ingredients is released immediately and the other is released slowly over a number of hours.
Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal tract caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (nasal blockage).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
In adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over, the recommended dose of Aerinaze 2 times a day is a tablet to be taken whole with a glass of water, with or without food.
The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and should be stopped as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal lining (clogged nose), have subsided.
Treatment of more than 10 days is not recommended because of the potential for the medicine to reduce its effect on nasal constipation.
Once the nose is clear, patients may take desloratadine on their own.
Aerinaze contains two active ingredients:
Desloratadine, an antihistamine, and pseudoephedrine, a nasal decongestant.
Desloratadine blocks the receptors at which histamine, an endogenous substance that causes allergic symptoms, is normally docked.
When the receptors are blocked, histamine cannot work and this helps to relieve the symptoms of allergy.
Pseudoephedrine stimulates the nerve endings to release the chemical messenger substance noradrenaline, which causes constriction (narrowing) of the blood vessels.
This causes less liquid to escape from the vessels, reducing swelling and reducing the amount of mucus excreted by the nose.
Aerinaze combines two medicinal products because one antihistamine on its own often does not provide adequate relief from symptoms in patients with nasal constipation.

The effectiveness of Aerinaze has been evaluated in two main studies involving a total of 1,248 adult and adolescent patients.
In both studies, Aerinaze was compared to desloratadine alone and to pseudoephedrine alone.
The main measures of efficacy were changes in the severity of hayfever symptoms reported by patients prior to and during the 15-day treatment.
During the trial, patients entered their symptoms in a diary every 12 hours and used a standard scale to assess how severe the symptoms were over the previous 12 hours.
What benefit has Aerinaze shown during the studies?
Aerinaze was more effective at relieving symptoms than both agents on their own.
When looking at all symptoms of hay fever except nose constipation, patients taking Aerinaze reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms compared to 35.9% of patients taking pseudoephedrine on its own.
When looking only at the swelling of the nasal lining, patients taking Aerinaze had 37.4% symptom relief compared to 26.7% for those taking desloratadine on its own.
Similar results were observed in the second study.
The most frequent side effects with Aerinaze (seen in 1 to 10 patients in 100) are tachycardia (heart racing), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), pharyngitis (inflammation of the throat), anorexia (loss of appetite), constipation, headache, tiredness, insomnia, somnolence, trouble sleeping and nervousness.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Aerinaze, see the Package Leaflet.
Do not use Aerinaze in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, to adrenergic agents or to loratadine (another medicinal product used to treat allergies).
It should not be used in patients who are taking or have stopped taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (e. g. some antidepressant medicinal products) for the last two weeks.
Nor should Aerinaze be used in patients who suffer from narrow angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), urinary retention (difficult urination), cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidism), have had a haemorrhagic stroke (stroke caused by a cerebral haemorrhage), or are at risk of a haemorrhagic stroke.
Der Ausschuss für Humanarzneimittel (CHMP) gelangte zu zu Schluss, dass die Vorteile von Aerinaze bei der symptomatic Behandlung der seasonalen allergic Rhinitis mit Nasenmumhautschwellung gegenüber den Risiken überwiegen, und empfahl, die Genehmigung für das Inverkehrbringen von Aerinaze zu erteilen. The Committee recommended that Aerinaze be given marketing authorisation.
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Aerinaze to SP Europe on 30 July 2007.

Treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis with associated nasal mucosal swelling.
Adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over:
The recommended dose of Aerinaze is one tablet taken twice daily.
The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but should be swallowed as a whole (i. e. without biting, breaking or chewing it).
Taking this medicine can be done regardless of meals.
Due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.
The duration of administration should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have resolved.
It is recommended to limit the duration of administration to 10 days, since in long term use the activity of pseudoephedrine may decrease over time.
After decreased swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment with desloratadine as monotherapy may be continued as necessary.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients, adrenergic agents or loratadine.
Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, it is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO/ inhibitor) and within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy.
Aerinaze is also contraindicated in patients with:
If you take more ACOMPLIA than you should if you take more ACOMPLIA than you should if you take more ACOMPLIA than you should.
This is attributable to the alphamimetic activity of pseudoephedrine in combination with other vasoconstrictors, such as bromocripitin, pergolide, lisuride, cabergolin, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine and other decongestants used perorally or nasally as decongestants (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazolin, naphazolin etc.).
Do not exceed the recommended dosage and duration of treatment (see section 4.2).
Patients over 60 years of age are more likely to experience adverse events with sympathomimetics such as pseudoephedrine.
The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been evaluated for this population and data are insufficient to make appropriate dose recommendations.
Caution should therefore be exercised when administering the combination to patients over 60 years of age.
The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze have not been evaluated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and data are insufficient to make appropriate dose recommendations.
The combination preparation is not recommended for use in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function.
Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age (see section 4.2).
Patients should be informed that if hypertension or tachycardia occurs, or if palpitations, cardiac dysrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or aggravation of headaches), treatment should be discontinued.
Sympathomimetic amines may cause central nervous system stimulation with seizures or cardiovascular collapse with hypotension.
These effects are more likely in children, elderly patients or in the event of an overdose (see section 4.9).
Caution is advised in the treatment of the following patient groups: patients under digital lights patients with cardiac dysrhythmia patients with hypertension patients with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, bladder obstruction or bronchospasm.
Caution should be exercised in patients with stenosising stomach ulcers and pyloroduodenal obstruction.
Caution is also advised in patients treated with other sympathomimetics.
These include: decongestants, anorectics or psychostimulants of amphetamine type 3 antihypertensive agents, tricyclic antidepressants and other antihistamines.
Caution should also be exercised in patients with migraine who are being treated with concomitant vasoconstricting ergotalkaloids.
Continuous use may lead to tolerance associated with an increased risk of overdose.
Acute hypertension may occur perioperatively with the use of mild volatile halogenated anaesthetics during therapy with indirect sympathomimetics.
Therefore, in the event of surgery, it is preferable to discontinue the treatment 24 hours prior to the start of anaesthesia.
Athletes should be advised that positive doping tests may be possible following therapy with pseudoephedrine.
Aerinaze should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological tests, as antihistamines may otherwise prevent or reduce the extent of positive reactions to indicators of skin reaction.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
However, in clinical trials of desloratadine added to erythromycin or ketoconazole, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadine were observed.
Reversible and irreversible MAO inhibitors may increase the risk of vessel narrowing and hypertension.
Concomitant administration of sympathomimetics may lead to critical hypertonic reactions.
The following concomitant therapies are not recommended: bromocriptine cabergoline lisuride, pergolide: risk of vessel narrowing and hypertension.
Dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergometrine: risk for vessel narrowing and hypertension.
Other vasoconstricting agents used orally or nasally as decongestant rhinologics (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazolin, naphazolin etc.):
Sympathomimetics may reduce the antihypertensive effect of -methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine, veratrum alkaloids and guanethidine.
The rate of absorption of pseudoephedrine sulphate is increased by antacids and decreased by kaolin.
The interaction between Aerinaze and alcohol has not been studied.
In a clinical pharmacological study, concomitant administration of desloratadine and alcohol was shown to increase the incidence of serious heart failure in patients taking the medicine.
The results of the psychomotor test could not detect significant differences between patients treated with desloratadine and those treated with placebo, whether desloratadine was taken on its own or with alcohol.
The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified and interaction with other medicinal products cannot be excluded.
Desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that CYP2D6 does not inhibit and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.
In animal experiments, neither desloratadine nor the combination of loratadine and pseudoephedrine was teratogenic.
Safety of use of Aerinaze during pregnancy has not been established but experience in a large number of affected pregnancies has not shown an increase in the frequency of malformations compared to the normal population.
As animal reproductive studies are not always transferable to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.
Desloratadine and pseudoephedrine are released into human milk.
Decreased milk production has been reported in nursing mothers in association with pseudoephedrine.
Therefore, Aerinaze should not be used in breast-feeding women.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect of Aerinaze on ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
No impairment was observed in patients receiving desloratadine in clinical trials to assess ability to drive.
However, patients should be advised that in very rare cases light-headedness may occur which may impair the ability to drive or use machines.
Pseudoephedrine sulphate is not expected to impair psychomotor function.
In clinical trials involving 414 adults, the most common adverse events observed were insomnia (8.9%), dry mouth (7.2%) and headaches (3.1%).
These and other adverse events that occurred in clinical trials are listed in the table below.
