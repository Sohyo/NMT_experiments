Adenuric is a medicinal product containing the active substance Febuxostat.
It is available as yellow, capsule shaped tablets (80 and 120 mg).
Adenuric is used to treat chronic (long term) hyperuricaemia (high levels of uric acid and urine in the blood).
Hyperuricaemia may see the formation of urine crystals and deposit them in the joints and kidneys.
When such deposition develops in the joints and causes pain, it is called gout.
Adenuric is used in patients who already show signs of crystal deposition, including arthritis (pain and inflammation in the joints) or rheumatoid nodes (stones i. e. larger urine crystal deposition that may cause joint and bone damage).
This medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
The recommended dose of Adenuric is 80 mg once a day.
It can be taken with or without meals.
Adenuric usually lowers uric acid levels in the blood within two weeks. If uric acid levels remain above 6 mg per deciliter after two to four weeks, the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day.
Attacks of gout may still occur during the first months of treatment; it is therefore recommended that patients take other medicines to prevent gout attacks during at least the first six months of treatment with Adenuric.
Adenuric treatment should not be discontinued if an attack of gout occurs.
The efficacy and safety of Adenuric have not been evaluated in patients with severe renal or liver problems.
This medicinal product is not recommended for paediatric and organ transplant patients as it has not been studied for these groups.
Feboxustat, an active substance in Adenuric, decreases the formation of uric acid.
It works by inhibiting an enzyme called xanthine oxidase, which is necessary for uric acid production in the body.
Due to a decrease in uric acid production, Adenuric

lower uric acid levels in the blood and maintain them at a lower level so that crystals cannot form and thus relieve the symptoms of gout. If uric acid levels are kept low enough, even existing rheumatoid nodes may become smaller. How has Adenuric been studied?
The effects of Adenuric were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
Adenuric s efficacy was investigated in two main studies in a total of 1,834 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout.
The first trial, in which 1,072 patients participated, compared the efficacy of three different doses of adenuric (80, 120 and 240 mg once a day) to that of placebo (apparent) and allopurinol (another medicinal product used to treat hyperuricaemia).
In the second study, two doses of Adenuric (80 and 120 mg once daily) for one year were compared to allopurinol in 762 patients.
In both studies, 300 mg of allopurinol was administered once daily; patients with renal problems received only 100 mg per day.
The main measure of efficacy was the number of patients whose uric acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg/ dl at the last three readings.
The uric acid level in the blood was measured each month.
What benefit has Adenuric shown in these trials?
Adenuric was more effective in lowering uric acid levels in the blood than allopurinol and placebo.
In the first trial, 48% (126 out of 262) of the patients taking 80 mg of adenuric at once daily dose and 65% (175 out of 269) of the patients taking 120 mg once daily had uric acid levels in their blood below 6 mg/ dl at the last three measurements.
This compared to 22% (60 out of 268) of patients receiving allopurinol and none of 134 receiving placebo.
The second study yielded similar results one year later.
The most frequent adverse reactions with Adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 patients in 100) are headache, diarrhoea, nausea, rash and abnormal liver values.
Particularly in patients with a history of heart discomfort, there may also be an increased risk of certain undesirable effects affecting the heart and blood vessels.
For a full list of side effects reported with Adenuric, see the Package Leaflet.
Adenuric must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Feboxustat or to any of the ingredients.
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that while Adenuric was more effective at lowering uric acid levels in the blood than allopurinol, it may also pose a higher risk of heart and blood vessel related side effects.
The Committee concluded that the benefits of Adenuric in treating chronic hyperuricaemia when urine deposition has occurred outweigh the risks and recommended that Adenuric be authorised to be marketed.
On 21 April 2008 the European Commission authorised Adenuric to be marketed throughout the European Union.
The holder of the marketing authorisation is Beaufour Ipsen Pharma.

ADROVANCE is a white capsule tablet containing two active ingredients: sodium alendronate 3 H2O (70 mg) and colecalciferol (vitamin D3, 70 micrograms equivalent to 2800 international units IU).
This medicinal product is identical to FOSAVANCE, which is already authorised in the European Union.
The manufacturer of FOSAVANCE has agreed that the scientific data on this product may also be used for ADROVANCE.
ADROVANCE is used to treat osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become fragile) in post-menopausal women who are at risk for low vitamin D levels.
ADROVANCE decreases the risk of spinal and hip fractures (fractures).
This medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
The recommended dose is one tablet once a week.
The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicinal products (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).
In order to avoid oesophageal irritation, the patient should not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which is not until 30 minutes after taking the tablet at the earliest.
Do not chew or swallow the tablet.
Patients should also take additional calcium if insufficient food is absorbed.
For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
Bone tissue is living tissue that is continually renewed by breaking down old bone tissue and replacing it with new.
Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones gradually become thin and fragile; there is an increased susceptibility to fracture (fractures).
This occurs when not enough new bone tissue grows to replace the naturally broken down bone.
Osteoporosis primarily occurs in post-menopausal women (after 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

Alendronate is a biphosphonate that has been used to treat osteoporosis since the mid 1990s.
It inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, cells involved in bone tissue breakdown. By blocking the activity of these cells, alendronate slows bone loss. Vitamin D3 is a nutrient found in some foods but also produced in the skin when exposed to natural sunlight. Vitamin D3, like other forms of vitamin D, is necessary for calcium uptake and normal bone formation. As osteoporosis patients may not produce enough vitamin D3 from exposure to the sun, this vitamin is included in ADROVANCE.
Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicinal products authorised in the European Union, the company presented data from previous studies and published literature.
The company also conducted a trial in 35 men and 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis to demonstrate ADROVANCE's efficacy in increasing vitamin D levels.
Patients received either ADROVANCE or alendronate once a week.
The main measure of efficacy was the percentage of patients with low vitamin D levels.
What benefit has ADROVANCE shown in these studies?
Following 15 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower (11%) in those treated with ADROVANCE than in those taking alendronate alone (32%).
The company also presented data showing that the alendronate dose in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.
The most frequent adverse reactions (observed in 1 to 10 in 100 patients) are headache, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and digestive system symptoms such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (indigestion), constipation, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (flatulence), ulcers (oesophagus), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), bloated abdomen (bloated abdomen) and acid belching.
For a full list of side effects reported with ADROVANCE, see the Package Leaflet.
In patients with possible hypersensitivity (allergy) to alendronate, vitamin D3 or to any of the ingredients, ADROVANCE should not be used.
Do not use in oesophageal disorders, in patients with hypocalcaemia (low calcium levels), or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that the benefits of ADROVANCE in the treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal patients at risk of vitamin D deficiency outweigh the risks and recommended that ADROVANCE be authorised to be marketed.
On 4 January 2007, the European Commission authorised Merck Sharp <unk> Dohme Ltd., to market ADROVANCE throughout the European Union.
The full EPAR for ADROVANCE is available here.
Each tablet contains 70 mg alendronic acid as sodium alendronate 3 H2O and 70 micrograms (2,800 IU) of colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Each tablet contains 62 mg lactose and 8 mg sucrose.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Capsule shaped, white to broken white tablets marked with the outline of a bone on one side and 710 on the other.
Treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in patients at risk of vitamin D deficiency.
ADROVANCE decreases the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.
The recommended dose is one ADROVANCE tablet once a week.
Due to the course of osteoporosis, ADROVANCE is intended for long term therapy.
other medicinal products to ensure adequate absorption of alendronate:
ADROVANCE should only be taken with water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before your first meal, drink or intake of medicinal products (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.
Other beverages (including mineral water), food and some medicinal products may affect the absorption of alendronate (see section 4.5).
The following recommendations should be followed closely to reduce the risk of oesophageal irritation and associated side effects (see section 4.4):
ADROVANCE should only be swallowed with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after getting up. Patients should not chew the tablet or allow the tablet to melt in the mouth as there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulcers. Patients should not lie down before the first food intake of the day, which should not be until 30 minutes after taking the tablet at the earliest.
Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking ADROVANCE. ADROVANCE should not be taken before bed or before getting up for the first time.
Patients should be supplemented with calcium if dietary supplementation is insufficient (see section 4.4).
Additional vitamin D supplementation should be considered on an individual basis, taking into account vitamin D uptake from vitamin supplements and supplements.
The equivalence of taking 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 once a week in ADROVANCE and 400 IU of vitamin D once a day has not been investigated.
In clinical trials, there was no age related difference in the efficacy or safety profile of alendronate.
Therefore, a dose adjustment in the elderly is not necessary.
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) exceeding 35 ml/ min.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for renal impairment patients with GFR below 35 ml/ min due to lack of experience.
ADROVANCE has not been studied in children and adolescents and should not be used in them.
Hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients or excipients. Oesophageal disorders and other factors that delay esophageal emptying, such as stricture or achalasia. inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes. Hypocalcaemia.
Alendronate Alendronate may cause local irritation to the mucosae of the upper gastrointestinal tract.
Due to the possible worsening of the underlying condition, special care should be taken with alendronate in patients with active gastro-intestinal disorders, such as dysphagia, esophagus disorders, gastritis, duodenitis, ulcers, or with recent (within the last year) severe gastro-intestinal disorders, such as peptic ulcer, active gastro-intestinal haemorrhage or upper gastro-intestinal surgery except for pyloroplasty (see section 4.3).
Oesophageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosions, rarely followed by oesophageal stricture, have been reported in patients taking alendronate (some of them severe and required hospitalization).
The physician should therefore be alert to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible oesophageal reactions and patients should be advised to discontinue the medicinal product and seek medical advice if symptoms of oesophageal irritation occur, such as dysphagia, swallowing pain or retrostar pain or new or worsening heartburn (see section 4.8).
The risk of severe oesophageal adverse reactions appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine<unk> or continue to take it after the onset of symptoms indicating oesophageal irritation.
It is very important that all dosage instructions are relayed to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).
Patients should be advised that if they do not adhere to these instructions, they may be at increased risk of oesophageal problems.
While no increased risk was detected in large scale clinical trials of alendronate, uncommon (post-marketing) stomach and duodenal ulcers, some severe and with complications, have been reported (see section 4.8).
jaw osteonecrosis, usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose regimens predominantly contain intravenously administered bisphosphonates.
Many of these patients also received chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
jaw osteonecrosis has also been reported in osteoporosis patients receiving oral bisphosphonates.
A dental examination with appropriate preventive measures should precede treatment with bisphosphonates if patients exhibit corresponding risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, periodontitis).
These patients should avoid maxillofacial surgery as much as possible during treatment.
If patients develop osteonecrosis of the jaw during bisphosphonate therapy, jaw surgery may lead to deterioration.
Data are not available to show whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy in patients in need of maxillofacial surgery decreases the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
The clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient on the basis of an individual benefit-risk assessment.
Bone, joint and / or muscle pain have been reported in bisphosphonates patients.
These post-marketing symptoms have rarely been severe and/ or associated with mobility restrictions (see section 4.8).
The timing of onset of these symptoms varied from one day to several months after initiation of therapy.
In most patients, symptoms decreased after discontinuation of therapy.
In some of the patients, symptoms recurred when therapy with the same medicinal product or another bisphosphonate was resumed.
Patients should be instructed that if they fail to take a dose of ADROVANCE the next morning after noticing their failure.
Do not take two tablets on the same day but continue to take one tablet per week on the designated day of the week as originally planned.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for renal failure patients with GFR below 35 ml/ min (see section 4.2).
Other possible causes of osteoporosis besides estrogen deficiency and age should be considered.
Existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected before ADROVANCE therapy is initiated (see section 4.3).
Other disorders that affect mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with ADROVANCE.
ADROVANCE vitamin D content is not indicated to treat vitamin D deficiency.
Patients with these disorders should be monitored under ADROVANCE therapy for serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcaemia.
Due to bone mineralization stimulation by alendronate, decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur.
However, rare cases of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, some severe, have been reported and often occurred in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (e. g. hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption) (see section 4.8).
Colecalciferol vitamin D3 may increase the extent of hypercalcaemia and/ or hypercalciuria when administered to patients with illnesses associated with uncontrolled overproduction of calcitriol (e. g. leukaemia, lymphoma, sarcoidosis).
Urine and serum calcium should be monitored.
Malabsorbed patients may not be receiving sufficient vitamin D3.
Excipients This medicinal product contains lactose and sucrose.
Patients with rare hereditary fructose intolerance, galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
Alendronate Food and drink (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicinal products may affect the absorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.
Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking other medicinal products (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
No other clinically relevant interactions with medicinal products are expected.
In clinical trials, several patients were receiving estrogen (intravaginal, transdermal or oral) concomitantly with alendronate.
Adverse reactions from this combination have not been observed.
Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, in clinical trials alendronate was administered concomitantly with a variety of commonly prescribed medicinal products without clinically relevant interactions occurring.
cholestyramine, colestipol) may affect the absorption of vitamin D.
Anticonvulsants, cimetidine and thiazides may increase the breakdown metabolism of vitamin D.
Additional vitamin D supplementation should be considered on an individual basis.
ADROVANCE is for use in post-menopausal women only and therefore cannot be used during pregnancy or by nursing women.
There are no adequate data on the use of ADROVANCE in pregnant women.
Animal studies of alendronate show no evidence of direct adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic or post-natal development.
Alendronate administered to pregnant rats caused dystokia associated with hypocalcaemia (see section 5.3).
Animal studies at high doses of vitamin D have shown hypercalcaemia and reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Alendronate is not known to be released into human milk.
Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites are released into human milk.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies have been carried out on ability to drive or use machines.
However, there is no information to suggest that ADROVANCE impairs the ability to drive or use machines.
The following adverse reactions have been reported during clinical trials and/ or post-marketing experience with alendronate.
No other undesirable effects have been observed for ADROVANCE.

Common: musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain.
Rare: severe musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain (see section 4.4).
Rare: symptomatic hypocalcaemia, usually in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (see section 4.4).
Rare: transient symptoms of acute phase reaction (myalgia, discomfort and rare fever), usually at the outset of therapy.
The following reactions have been reported (frequency unknown):
jaw osteonecrosis has been reported in bisphosphonate patients; most reports have been from cancer patients, but osteoporosis patients have also been reported.
jaw osteonecrosis is usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis).
Cancer diagnosis, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also considered risk factors (see section 4.4).
Laboratory scores In clinical trials, asymptomatic, mild and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18% and 10% of patients taking alendronate 10 mg/ day, compared to approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo, respectively.
However, decreases in serum calcium to <unk> 8.0 mg/ dl (2.0 mmol/ l) and serum phosphate to 2.0 mg/ dl (0.65 mmol/ l) occurred with a similar frequency in both treatment groups.
Oral overdose may result in hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia and upper gastrointestinal effects such as upset stomach, heartburn, oesophagitis, gastritis or ulcers.
No specific experience exists to treat overdose with alendronate.
If an overdose with ADROVANCE occurs, milk or antacids should be administered to bind to alendronate.
Due to the risk of oesophageal irritation, vomiting should not be initiated and the patient should remain upright.
Colecalciferol No vitamin D toxicity has been documented for doses less than 10,000 IU/ day In a clinical trial in healthy adults, a daily dose of 4,000 IU
vitamin D3 for up to 5 months not associated with hypercalciuria or hypercalcaemia.
ADROVANCE is a combination tablet containing the active ingredients sodium alendronate 3 H2O and colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Alendronate Sodium alendronate 3 H2O is a bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts without exerting a direct effect on bone formation.
Preclinical studies have shown that alendronate is preferred at sites of active absorption
. Osteoclast activity is inhibited, but osteoclast recruitment and attachment are not affected.
The bone produced during treatment with alendronate is of normal quality.
Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3.
If insufficient sunlight is received, it is essential that vitamin D3 is part of the diet.
Vitamin D3 is converted by the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and stored until it is needed.
Renal conversion to the active calcium mobilising hormone 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) is strictly regulated.
The main effect of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and to regulate serum calcium, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.
vitamin D3 is required for normal bone formation.
Vitamin D deficiency occurs when exposure to the sun and food intake are insufficient.
Deficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, bone loss and an increased risk of skeletal fracture.
In severe cases, deficiency may lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphataemia, proximal muscle weakness and osteomalacia, further increasing the risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic subjects.
Vitamin D supplementation will reduce these risks and their consequences.
bone mineral density) in the spine or hip that is 2.5 standard deviations below the mean for a normal, young population, or regardless of bone density as a pathological fracture present.
trials with ADROVANCE ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronat/ 2,800 IU of vitamin D3) effect on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15 week, multinational trial in 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis (mean serum baseline of 25-hydroxyvitamin D: 56 nmol/ l / 22.3 ng/ ml <unk>; range: 22.5 -225 nmol/ l <unk> 9-90 ng/ ml <unk>).
Patients were receiving lower strength ADROVANCE (70 mg / 2,800 IU) (n/ 350) or FOSAMAX (alendronate) 70 mg once a week (n/ 332); further vitamin D supplements were prohibited.
After 15 weeks of treatment, mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher (26%) in the ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (56 nmol/ l <unk> 23 ng/ ml <unk>) group than in the alendronate group alone (46 nmol/ l <unk> 18.2 ng/ ml <unk>).
ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) significantly decreased the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <unk> 37.5 nmol/ l <unk> 15 ng/ ml <unk>) by 62.5% compared to alendronate alone (12% vs.
32%).
ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) significantly decreased the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <unk> 22.5 nmol/ l <unk> 9 ng/ ml <unk>) by 92% compared to alendronate alone (1% vs. 13%).
In this trial, at 15 weeks, mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in patients with vitamin D deficiency at the start of the trial (25-hydroxyvitamin D 22.5 to 37.5 nmol/ l / 9 - <unk> 15 ng/ ml <unk>) increased from 30 nmol/ l (12.1 ng/ ml) to 40 nmol/ l (15.9 ng/ ml) in the ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n<unk> 75) group and decreased from 30 nmol/ l (12.0 ng/ ml) at the start of the trial to 26 nmol/ l (10.4 ng/ ml) in the alendronate alone group (n<unk> 70).
There were no differences between treatment groups with regard to the mean values of serum calcium, phosphate or calcium in 24-hour urine.
trials of alendronate The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate given weekly 70 mg (n/ 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n/ 370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicenter trial in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.
Elevations above baseline lumbar spine BMD were 5.1% (95% CI:
4.8, 5.4%) in the 70 mg weekly and 5.4% (95% CI:
5.0, 5.8%) in the 10 mg daily group.
Mean BMD increases were 2.3% and 2.9% for the femoral neck and 2.9% and 3.1% for the entire hip, respectively, in the 70 mg weekly and 10 mg daily groups.
8 treatment groups were also similar in BMD increases at other skeletal sites.
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were investigated in two phase III studies of identical design (n/ 944) and in the Fracture Intervention Study (FIT: n/ 6,459).
In the phase IIIs, mean increases in BMD with alendronate 10 mg/ day versus placebo at 3 years were 8.8% in the spine, 5.9% in the femoral neck and 7.8% in the trochanter.
The BMD of the entire skeleton also increased significantly.
In the alendronate treated group, a 48% reduction (alendronate 3.2% vs. placebo 6.2%) was achieved in the proportion of patients who sustained one or more vertebral fractures.
Throughout the two year extension of these trials, spine and trochanter BMD increases continued and femoral neck and body BMD was maintained.
FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled trials in which alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily for either 1 or 2 years):
FIT 1: a three year trial involving 2,027 patients with at least one pre-existing vertebral <unk> compression <unk> fracture.
In this study, daily alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% vs. placebo 15.0%).
In addition, a significant reduction in the incidence of hip fractures was observed (1.1% versus 2.2%; reduction of 51%).
FIT 2: a four-year trial involving 4,432 patients with low bone mass but no pre-existing vertebral fracture.
In this study, a significant difference in the incidence of hip fractures (alendronate 1.0% vs. placebo 2.2%; reduction of 56%) and in the incidence of at least one vertebral fracture (2.9% vs. 5.8%; reduction of 50%) was observed in analysis of the subgroup of osteoporotic women (37% of the total number who suffered from osteoporosis according to the above definition).
Absorption Based on a reference intravenous dose, the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nocturnal fasting and two hours prior to eating a standardized breakfast.
Bioavailability decreased correspondingly to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% when alendronate was taken one or half an hour prior to a standardized breakfast.
In osteoporosis studies, alendronate was effective when taken at least 30 minutes prior to the first meal or drink of the day.
The alendronate component of the ADROVANCE combination tablet (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) and the 70 mg alendronate tablet are bioequivalent.
Bioavailability was minimal when alendronate was administered with or up to two hours after a standardized breakfast.
Alendronate concomitantly with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60 <unk>.
In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg 3 times daily for five days) did not lead to any clinically important change in oral bioavailability of alendronate (mean increase in the 20% to 44% range).
Distribution Studies in rats have shown that alendronate temporarily distributes to soft tissue after intravenous administration of 1 mg/ kg, but is then rapidly redistributed to bone or excreted in the urine.
The mean steady-state volume of distribution is at least 28 litres in humans, excluding bone.
Plasma concentrations after oral therapeutic doses of alendronate are too low for analytical detection (<unk> 5 ng/ ml).
Protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78 <unk>.
biotransformation There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolised in animals or humans.
Excretion After intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C-alendronate, approximately 50% of the radiolabelled substance was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was recovered in the faeces.
After the intravenous single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml/ min and the systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml/ min.
Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95% within six hours after intravenous administration.
The terminal half-life in humans is estimated to exceed ten years when alendronate is released from the skeleton.
Alendronate in rats is not excreted via the acidic or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and is therefore not thought to affect the excretion of other medicinal products through these transport systems in humans.
Absorption In healthy adult subjects (women and men) after ADROVANCE was administered after nocturnal fasting and two hours before meal, the mean surface area below the serum concentration time curve (AUC0-120 h) for vitamin D3 was 296.4 ng h/ ml (excluding endogenous vitamin D3 levels).
The mean maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of vitamin D3 was 5.9 ng/ ml and the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (Tmax) was 12 hours.
The bioavailability of 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 in ADROVANCE is similar to that of 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 taken alone.
Distribution After absorption, vitamin D3 is absorbed by the blood as a component of chylomicrons.
Vitamin D3 is rapidly distributed, primarily to the liver, where it is metabolised into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the main store.
Smaller amounts are distributed in fat and muscle tissue where they are stored as vitamin D3 for later circulation.
Circulating vitamin D3 is bound to vitamin D-binding protein.
biotransformation Vitamin D3 is rapidly hydroxylated by the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and then metabolised by the kidney to 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D3, the biologically active form.
Further hydroxylation occurs before excretion.
A small fraction of vitamin D3 is glucuronised prior to excretion.
Excretion When radiolabelled vitamin D3 was administered to healthy subjects, the mean excretion of radioactivity in the urine at 48 hours was 2.4%, in the faeces at four days 4.9 <unk>.
In both cases, radioactivity was excreted almost exclusively as metabolites of the starting substance.
The mean half-life of vitamin D3 in the serum is approximately 24 hours after an oral dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU).
Characteristics in patients Preclinical studies have shown that the fraction of alendronate not deposited in the bone is rapidly excreted via the urine.
No evidence of saturation of bone absorption after long term doses of cumulative intravenous doses to
10 35 mg/ kg in animals. Although no clinical data are available, renal elimination of alendronate is expected to be reduced, as in animal studies, even in patients with impaired renal function.
Patients with renal impairment may therefore expect somewhat increased accumulation of alendronate in bone (see section 4.2).
No non-clinical trials were conducted with the combination of alendronate and colecalciferol.
Alendronate Non-clinical data based on conventional trials in safety pharmacology, chronic toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential do not reveal any specific risks to humans.
Studies in rats showed that administration of alendronate to pregnant rats was associated with the occurrence of dystokia in their mothers due to hypocalcaemia.
In studies, high doses in rats caused an increased occurrence of incomplete fetal ossification.
The relevance of this observation for humans is unknown.
Colecalciferol Animal studies, reproductive toxicity effects have been observed at doses far higher than the therapeutic dose in humans.

Treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in patients at risk of vitamin D deficiency who are not receiving additional vitamin D supplementation.
ADROVANCE decreases the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.
The recommended dose is one ADROVANCE tablet once a week.
Due to the course of osteoporosis, ADROVANCE is intended for long term therapy.
other medicinal products to ensure adequate absorption of alendronate:
ADROVANCE should only be taken with water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before your first meal, drink or intake of medicinal products (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.
Other beverages (including mineral water), food and some medicinal products may affect the absorption of alendronate (see section 4.5).
The following recommendations should be followed closely to reduce the risk of oesophageal irritation and associated side effects (see section 4.4):
ADROVANCE should only be swallowed with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after getting up. Patients should not chew the tablet or allow the tablet to melt in the mouth as there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulcers. Patients should not lie down before the first food intake of the day, which should not be until 30 minutes after taking the tablet at the earliest.
Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking ADROVANCE. ADROVANCE should not be taken before bedtime or before getting up for the first time.
Patients should be supplemented with calcium if dietary supplementation is insufficient (see section 4.4).
The equivalent of taking 5,600 IU of
vitamin D3 once a week in ADROVANCE and 800 IU.
vitamin D supplementation once a day has not been studied.
In clinical trials, there was no age related difference in the efficacy or safety profile of alendronate.
Therefore, a dose adjustment in the elderly is not necessary.
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) exceeding 35 ml/ min.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for renal impairment patients with GFR below 35 ml/ min due to lack of experience.
ADROVANCE has not been studied in children and adolescents and should not be used in them.
Hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients or excipients. Oesophageal disorders and other factors that delay esophageal emptying, such as stricture or achalasia. inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes. Hypocalcaemia.
Alendronate Alendronate may cause local irritation to the mucosae of the upper gastrointestinal tract.
Due to the possible worsening of the underlying condition, special care should be taken with alendronate in patients with active gastro-intestinal disorders, such as dysphagia, esophagus disorders, gastritis, duodenitis, ulcers, or with recent (within the last year) severe gastro-intestinal disorders, such as peptic ulcer, active gastro-intestinal haemorrhage or upper gastro-intestinal surgery except for pyloroplasty (see section 4.3).
Oesophageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosions, rarely followed by oesophageal stricture, have been reported in patients taking alendronate (some of them severe and required hospitalization).
The physician should therefore be alert to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible oesophageal reactions and patients should be advised to discontinue the medicinal product and seek medical advice if symptoms of oesophageal irritation occur, such as dysphagia, swallowing pain or retrostar pain or new or worsening heartburn (see section 4.8).
The risk of severe oesophageal adverse reactions appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine<unk> or continue to take it after the onset of symptoms indicating oesophageal irritation.
It is very important that all dosage instructions are relayed to the patient and understood by the patient
patients should be advised that if they do not adhere to these instructions, they may be at increased risk of oesophageal problems.
While no increased risk was detected in large scale clinical trials of alendronate, uncommon (post-marketing) stomach and duodenal ulcers, some severe and with complications, have been reported (see section 4.8).
jaw osteonecrosis, usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose regimens predominantly contain intravenously administered bisphosphonates.
Many of these patients also received chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
jaw osteonecrosis has also been reported in osteoporosis patients receiving oral bisphosphonates.
A dental examination with appropriate preventive measures should precede treatment with bisphosphonates if patients exhibit corresponding risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, periodontitis).
These patients should avoid maxillofacial surgery as much as possible during treatment.
If patients develop osteonecrosis of the jaw during bisphosphonate therapy, jaw surgery may lead to deterioration.
Data are not available to show whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy in patients in need of maxillofacial surgery decreases the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
The clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient on the basis of an individual benefit-risk assessment.
Bone, joint and / or muscle pain have been reported in bisphosphonates patients.
These post-marketing symptoms have rarely been severe and/ or associated with mobility restrictions (see section 4.8).
The timing of onset of these symptoms varied from one day to several months after initiation of therapy.
In most patients, symptoms decreased after discontinuation of therapy.
In some of the patients, symptoms recurred when therapy with the same medicinal product or another bisphosphonate was resumed.
Patients should be instructed that if they fail to take a dose of ADROVANCE the next morning after noticing their failure.
Do not take two tablets on the same day but continue to take one tablet per week on the designated day of the week as originally planned.
ADROVANCE is not recommended for renal failure patients with GFR below 35 ml/ min (see section 4.2).
Other possible causes of osteoporosis besides estrogen deficiency and age should be considered.
Existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected before ADROVANCE therapy is initiated (see section 4.3).
Other disorders that affect mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with ADROVANCE.
ADROVANCE vitamin D content is not indicated to treat vitamin D deficiency.
Patients with these disorders should be monitored under ADROVANCE therapy for serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcaemia.
Due to bone mineralization stimulation by alendronate, decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur.
However, rare cases of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, some severe even 15, have been reported and frequently occurred in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (e. g. hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption) (see section 4.8).
Colecalciferol vitamin D3 may increase the extent of hypercalcaemia and/ or hypercalciuria when administered to patients with illnesses associated with uncontrolled overproduction of calcitriol (e. g. leukaemia, lymphoma, sarcoidosis).
Urine and serum calcium should be monitored.
Malabsorbed patients may not be receiving sufficient vitamin D3.
Excipients This medicinal product contains lactose and sucrose.
Patients with rare hereditary fructose intolerance, galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
Alendronate Food and drink (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicinal products may affect the absorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.
Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking other medicinal products (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
No other clinically relevant interactions with medicinal products are expected.
In clinical trials, several patients were receiving estrogen (intravaginal, transdermal or oral) concomitantly with alendronate.
Adverse reactions from this combination have not been observed.
Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, in clinical trials alendronate was administered concomitantly with a variety of commonly prescribed medicinal products without clinically relevant interactions occurring.
cholestyramine, colestipol) may affect the absorption of vitamin D.
Anticonvulsants, cimetidine and thiazides may increase the breakdown metabolism of vitamin D.
Additional vitamin D supplementation should be considered on an individual basis.
ADROVANCE is for use in post-menopausal women only and therefore cannot be used during pregnancy or by nursing women.
There are no adequate data on the use of ADROVANCE in pregnant women.
Animal studies of alendronate show no evidence of direct adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic or post-natal development.
Alendronate administered to pregnant rats caused dystokia associated with hypocalcaemia (see section 5.3).
Animal studies at high doses of vitamin D have shown hypercalcaemia and reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Alendronate is not known to be released into human milk.
Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites are released into human milk.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies have been carried out on ability to drive or use machines.
However, there is no information to suggest that ADROVANCE impairs the ability to drive or use machines.
The following adverse reactions have been reported during clinical trials and/ or post-marketing experience with alendronate.
No other undesirable effects have been observed for ADROVANCE.
<unk> Common (1/ 100, <unk> 1/ 10), rare (1/ 1,000, <unk> 1/ 100), rare (1/ 10,000, <unk> 1/ 1,000), very rare (<unk> 1/ 10,000) <unk>

Uncommon: nausea, vomiting, gastritis, oesophagitis*, oesophageal erosions*, melena. Rare: oesophagus stricture *, oropharyngeal ulceration*, perforations, ulcers and upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (see section 4.4<unk>. * See sections 4.2 and 4.4.
rash, pruritus, erythema. Rare: rash with photosensitivity. Very rare: severe skin reactions including Stevenson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Common: musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain.
Rare: severe musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain (see section 4.4).
Rare: symptomatic hypocalcaemia, usually in patients with corresponding predisposing factors (see section 4.4).
Rare: transient symptoms of acute phase reaction (myalgia, discomfort and rare fever), usually at the outset of therapy.
The following reactions have been reported (frequency unknown):
jaw osteonecrosis has been reported in bisphosphonate patients; most reports have been from cancer patients, but osteoporosis patients have also been reported.
jaw osteonecrosis is usually associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis).
Cancer diagnosis, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also considered risk factors (see section 4.4).
Laboratory scores In clinical trials, asymptomatic, mild and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18% and 10% of patients taking alendronate 10 mg/ day, compared to approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo, respectively.
However, decreases in serum calcium to <unk> 8.0 mg/ dl (2.0 mmol/ l) and serum phosphate to 2.0 mg/ dl (0.65 mmol/ l) occurred with a similar frequency in both treatment groups.
Oral overdose may result in hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia and upper gastrointestinal effects such as upset stomach, heartburn, oesophagitis, gastritis or ulcers.
No specific experience exists to treat overdose with alendronate.
If an overdose with ADROVANCE occurs, milk or antacids should be administered to bind to alendronate.
Due to the risk of oesophageal irritation, vomiting should not be initiated and the patient should remain upright.
Colecalciferol No vitamin D toxicity has been documented for doses less than 10,000 IU/ day In a clinical trial in healthy adults, a daily dose of 4,000 IU
vitamin D3 for up to 5 months not associated with hypercalciuria or hypercalcaemia.
ADROVANCE is a combination tablet containing the active ingredients sodium alendronate 3 H2O and colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Alendronate Sodium alendronate 3 H2O is a bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts without exerting a direct effect on bone formation.
Preclinical studies have shown that alendronate preferably concentrates at sites of active absorption.
The activity of the osteoclasts is inhibited, but osteoclast recruitment and attachment are not affected.
The bone produced during treatment with alendronate is of normal quality.
Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3.
If insufficient sunlight is received, it is essential that vitamin D3 is part of the diet.
Vitamin D3 is converted by the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and stored until it is needed.
Renal conversion to the active calcium mobilising hormone 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) is strictly regulated.
The main effect of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and to regulate serum calcium, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.
vitamin D3 is required for normal bone formation.
Vitamin D deficiency occurs when exposure to the sun and food intake are insufficient.
Deficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, bone loss and an increased risk of skeletal fracture.
In severe cases, deficiency may lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphataemia, proximal muscle weakness and osteomalacia, further increasing the risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic subjects.
Vitamin D supplementation will reduce these risks and their consequences.
bone mineral density) in the spine or hip that is 2.5 standard deviations below the mean for a normal, young population, or regardless of bone density as a pathological fracture present.
trials with ADROVANCE The effect of the lower dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronate/ 2,800 IU of vitamin D3) on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15 week, multinational trial in 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis (mean serum baseline of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D: 56 nmol/ l <unk> 22.3 ng/ ml <unk>; range: 22.5 -225 nmol/ l <unk> 9 -90 ng/ ml <unk>).
Patients were receiving lower strength ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n/ 350) or FOSAMAX (alendronate) 70 mg once a week (n/ 332); further vitamin D supplements were prohibited.
After 15 weeks of treatment, mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher (26%) in the ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (56 nmol/ l <unk> 23 ng/ ml <unk>) group than in the alendronate group alone (46 nmol/ l <unk> 18.2 ng/ ml <unk>).
ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) significantly decreased the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <unk> 37.5 nmol/ l <unk> 15 ng/ ml <unk>) by 62.5% compared to alendronate alone (12% vs.
32%).
ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) significantly decreased the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <unk> 22.5 nmol/ l <unk> 9 ng/ ml <unk>) by 92% compared to alendronate alone (1% vs. 13%).
In this trial, at 15 weeks, mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in patients with vitamin D deficiency at the start of the trial (25-hydroxyvitamin D 22.5 to 37.5 nmol/ l / 9 - <unk> 15 ng/ ml <unk>) increased from 30 nmol/ l (12.1 ng/ ml) to 40 nmol/ l (15.9 ng/ ml) in the ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n<unk> 75) group and decreased from 30 nmol/ l (12.0 ng/ ml) at the start of the trial to 26 nmol/ l (10.4 ng/ ml) in the alendronate alone group (n<unk> 70).
There were no differences between treatment groups with regard to the mean values of serum calcium, phosphate or calcium in 24-hour urine.
The effect of the lower dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg alendronat/ 2,800 IU of vitamin D3) with an additional 2,800 IU of vitamin D3, totaling 5,600 IU
vitamin D3 (the amount of vitamin D3 in the higher dose of ADROVANCE) given weekly has been demonstrated in a 24-week extension trial in 619 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.
2,800 IU of vitamin D3 group received ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU) (n/ 299), and 5,600 IU of vitamin D3 group received ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU), and an additional 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 (n/ 309) once a week; additional vitamin D supplements were allowed; after 24 weeks of treatment, mean serum levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher in the 5,600 IU of vitamin D3 (69 nmol/ l / 27.6 ng/ ml <unk>) than in the 2,800 IU of vitamin D3 group (64 nmol/ l / 25.5 ng/ ml <unk>).
The proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency during the 24 week extension trial was 5.4% in the 2,800 IU vitamin D3 group vs.
3.2% in the 5,600 IU vitamin D3 group, and
19 vitamin D deficiency was 0.3% in the 2,800 IU vitamin D3 group vs. 0% in the 5,600 IU vitamin D3 group.
There were no differences between treatment groups in terms of averages of serum calcium, phosphate or calcium in 24-hour urine.
There was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups in the proportion of patients with hypercalciuria at the end of the 24-week extension.
trials of alendronate The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate given weekly 70 mg (n/ 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n/ 370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicenter trial in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.
Elevations above baseline lumbar spine BMD were 5.1% (95% CI:
4.8, 5.4%) in the 70 mg weekly and 5.4% (95% CI:
5.0, 5.8%) in the 10 mg daily group.
Mean BMD increases were 2.3% and 2.9% for the femoral neck and 2.9% and 3.1% for the total hip, respectively, in the 70 mg weekly and 10 mg daily groups.
The two treatment groups were also similar in BMD increases at other skeletal sites.
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were investigated in two phase III studies of identical design (n/ 944) and in the Fracture Intervention Study (FIT: n/ 6,459).
In the phase IIIs, mean increases in BMD with alendronate 10 mg/ day versus placebo at 3 years were 8.8% in the spine, 5.9% in the femoral neck and 7.8% in the trochanter.
The BMD of the entire skeleton also increased significantly.
In the alendronate treated group, a 48% reduction (alendronate 3.2% vs. placebo 6.2%) was achieved in the proportion of patients who sustained one or more vertebral fractures.
Throughout the two year extension of these trials, spine and trochanter BMD increases continued and femoral neck and body BMD was maintained.
FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled trials in which alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily for either 1 or 2 years):
FIT 1: a three year trial involving 2,027 patients with at least one pre-existing vertebral <unk> compression <unk> fracture.
In this study, daily alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% vs. placebo 15.0%).
In addition, a significant reduction in the incidence of hip fractures was observed (1.1% versus 2.2%; reduction of 51%).
FIT 2: a four-year trial involving 4,432 patients with low bone mass but no pre-existing vertebral fracture.
In this study, a significant difference in the incidence of hip fractures (alendronate 1.0% vs. placebo 2.2%; reduction of 56%) and in the incidence of at least one vertebral fracture (2.9% vs. 5.8%; reduction of 50%) was observed in analysis of the subgroup of osteoporotic women (37% of the total number who suffered from osteoporosis according to the above definition).
Absorption Based on a reference intravenous dose, the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nocturnal fasting and two hours prior to eating a standardized breakfast.
Bioavailability decreased correspondingly to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% when alendronate was administered one or half an hour prior to a standardized breakfast
20. In osteoporosis studies, alendronate was effective if taken at least 30 minutes prior to the first meal or drink of the day.
The alendronate component of the ADROVANCE combination tablet (70 mg/ 5,600 IU) and a tablet of 70 mg alendronate are bioequivalent.
Bioavailability was minimal when alendronate was administered with or up to two hours after a standardized breakfast.
Alendronate concomitantly with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60 <unk>.
In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg 3 times daily for five days) did not lead to any clinically important change in oral bioavailability of alendronate (mean increase in the 20% to 44% range).
Distribution Studies in rats have shown that alendronate temporarily distributes to soft tissue after intravenous administration of 1 mg/ kg, but is then rapidly redistributed to bone or excreted in the urine.
The mean steady-state volume of distribution is at least 28 litres in humans, excluding bone.
Plasma concentrations after oral therapeutic doses of alendronate are too low for analytical detection (<unk> 5 ng/ ml).
Protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78 <unk>.
biotransformation There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolised in animals or humans.
Excretion After intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C-alendronate, approximately 50% of the radiolabelled substance was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was recovered in the faeces.
After the intravenous single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml/ min and the systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml/ min.
Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95% within six hours after intravenous administration.
The terminal half-life in humans is estimated to exceed ten years when alendronate is released from the skeleton.
Alendronate in rats is not excreted via the acidic or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and is therefore not thought to affect the excretion of other medicinal products through these transport systems in humans.
Absorption In healthy adult subjects (women and men) after ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 5,600 IU) was administered after nocturnal fasting and two hours before meal, the mean surface area below the serum concentration time curve (AUC0-80 h) for vitamin D3 was 490.2 ng h/ ml (excluding endogenous vitamin D3 levels).
The mean maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of vitamin D3 was 12.2 ng/ ml and the median time to reach the peak serum concentration (Tmax) was 10.6 hours.
The bioavailability of 5,600 IU of vitamin D3 in ADROVANCE is similar to that of 5,600 IU of vitamin D3 taken alone.
Distribution After absorption, vitamin D3 is absorbed by the blood as a component of chylomicrons.
Vitamin D3 is rapidly distributed, primarily to the liver, where it is metabolised into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the main store.
Smaller amounts are distributed in fat and muscle tissue where they are stored as vitamin D3 for later circulation.
Circulating vitamin D3 is bound to vitamin D-binding protein.
21 Vitamin D3 is rapidly hydroxylated by the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and then metabolised by the kidney to 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D3, the biologically active form.
Further hydroxylation occurs before excretion.
A small fraction of vitamin D3 is glucuronised prior to excretion.
Excretion When radiolabelled vitamin D3 was administered to healthy subjects, the mean excretion of radioactivity in the urine at 48 hours was 2.4%, in the faeces at four days 4.9 <unk>.
In both cases, radioactivity was excreted almost exclusively as metabolites of the starting substance.
The mean half-life of vitamin D3 in the serum is approximately 24 hours after an oral dose of ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2,800 IU).
Characteristics in patients Preclinical studies have shown that the fraction of alendronate not deposited in the bone is rapidly excreted via the urine.
No evidence of bone saturation after long term doses of cumulative intravenous doses up to 35 mg/ kg in animals.
Although no clinical data are available, renal elimination of alendronate is expected to be reduced in patients with impaired renal function, as in animal studies.
Patients with renal impairment may therefore expect somewhat increased accumulation of alendronate in bone (see section 4.2).
No non-clinical trials were conducted with the combination of alendronate and colecalciferol.
Alendronate Non-clinical data based on conventional trials in safety pharmacology, chronic toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential do not reveal any specific risks to humans.
Studies in rats showed that administration of alendronate to pregnant rats was associated with the occurrence of dystokia in their mothers due to hypocalcaemia.
In studies, high doses in rats caused an increased occurrence of incomplete fetal ossification.
The relevance of this observation for humans is unknown.
Colecalciferol Animal studies, reproductive toxicity effects have been observed at doses far higher than the therapeutic dose in humans.

Treatment with Advate should be initiated by a physician with experience in the treatment of haemophilia.
Advate is administered by injection into a vein at a rate of up to 10 ml per minute.
The dosage and frequency of administration will vary with whether Advate is used to treat haemorrhage or to prevent haemorrhage during surgery.
Moreover, the dosage is adjusted according to the severity of the haemorrhage and the type of surgery.
Detailed information on the calculation of doses is available in the Package Leaflet.
The active substance in Advate, Octocog alfa, is a protein in the blood coagulation factor.
Factor VIII is one of the substances (factors) in the body that contributes to blood clotting.
Patients with haemophilia A suffer from factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood to clot, such as bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.
Advate is used to replace the missing factor VIII.
Corrects for factor VIII deficiency and allows for temporary control of the bleeding disorder.
Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced by a method known as recombinant DNA technology:
It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) has been introduced that enables it to form human clotting factor VIII.

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is recognised. How has Advate been investigated? Advate is similar to another medicinal product authorised in the European Union called Recombinate but manufactured in a different way and does not contain human or animal source proteins.
Therefore, in a main study of 111 patients with haemophilia A, Advate was compared to Recombinate to show that both medicinal products are equivalent. In addition, in 107 patients who received all of Advate, the number of bleeding episodes and the efficacy of Advate in haemostasis was evaluated on a scale from ineffective to excellent. Three additional trials in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a trial of 53 children under six years of age, investigated the use of the blood prevention and surgery medicinal product.
What benefit has Advate shown in these trials?
In the main study, Advate's efficacy in preventing haemorrhage in 86% of 510 new bleeding episodes was either excellent or well assessed.
Moreover, in 81% of these bleeding episodes, only one treatment with Advate was necessary.
The additional studies, including the study in children under six years of age, confirmed the efficacy of Advate.
Patients with haemophilia A may produce antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII.
An antibody is a protein produced by the body in response to unknown substances because of its natural protective mechanism.
If antibodies develop, the effectiveness of Advate is not assured.
The most frequent adverse reactions with Advate (observed in 1 to 10 patients in 100) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever), and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII.
Hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) has been observed in some patients treated with medicinal products containing factor VIII.
For a full list of reported side effects with Advate, see the Package Leaflet.
Do not use Advate in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or to any of the excipients.
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Advate in the treatment and propyhlaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital deficiency in factor VIII) outweigh the risks and recommended that marketing authorisation for Advate be granted.
On 2 March 2004, the European Commission authorised Baxter AG to market Advate throughout the European Union.
The authorisation was renewed on 2 March 2009.
The full EPAR for Advate is available here.

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be conducted under the supervision of a physician familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the seriousness of Factor VIII deficiency, on the site and extent of the haemorrhage and on the clinical condition of the patient.
Needs Treatment The Factor VIII dose is given in International Units (IU) in line with the WHO standard for Factor VIII products.
Factor VIII-activity in plasma is presented either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
1 IU of factor VIII-activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in a ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required Factor VIII dose is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU
Factor VIII per kg bodyweight, factor VIII-activity in plasma is increased by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII increase (%) x 0.5
Following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII-activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or IU/ dl) during the corresponding period.
The following table 1 indicates the dosage for haemorrhage and surgery:

injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours for patients under 6 years of age) until the risk to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12-24 hours for patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours for patients under 6 years of age) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity of 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted to reflect the clinical efficacy of the product in each case.
In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate Factor VIII plasma levels are advised in order to control the dose and frequency of injections.
Especially for major surgery, close monitoring of substitution therapy by determination of factor VIII-activity in plasma is imperative.
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII, may achieve different in vivo recovery and may have different half-lives.
3 Prophylaxis Doses between 20 and 40 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight should be administered 2-3 days apart to prevent long term bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A
In patients under 6 years of age, doses between 20 and 50 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 3 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored on a regular basis for the formation of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII-plasma activities are not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitors, Factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures may need to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in treating patients with haemophilia. See section 4.4.
method of administration ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate prior training is necessary.
The rate of administration should vary with the patient and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml/ min should not be exceeded.
In the interests of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, note down the name and batch number of the product.
For information on reconstitution prior to administration, see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be alert to immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction, such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory discomfort (e. g. chest tightness, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should discontinue treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
In the case of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be based on current medical standards (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A
These inhibitors are always anti-procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins quantified in Bethesda units (BU) per ml of plasma by a modified Bethesda assay.
Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors may experience an inadequate clinical response.
In such cases, contact a haemophilia centre is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the highest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and dependent on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 days of exposure and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (low-titer) inhibitors has been observed after transfer from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with blood clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for developmental inhibitors. See section 4.8.
This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial after reconstitution.
This must be considered for patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
No interaction studies of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been conducted.
Reproduction studies in animals have not been performed with factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, no experience exists with the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding.
Therefore, in pregnancy and breast-feeding, factor VIII should only be used if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
As with any intravenous protein, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions may occur (see section 4.4).
A total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 out of 234 once treated patients during clinical trials of ADVATE.
The ADRs that occurred in the largest number of patients were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of whom occurred in previously untreated patients at higher risk of forming inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Out of a total of 56 adverse reactions, no were observed in newborns, 16 were reported in 13/ 32 infants, 7 in 4/ 56 children, 8 in 4/ 31 adolescents and 25 in 14/ 94 adults 1.
Frequency categories are defined by the following criteria: Very common (1/ 10), common (1/ 100 to 1/ 10), uncommon (1/ 1,000 to 1/ 100), rare (1/ 10,000 to 1/ 1,000), very rare <unk> 1/ 10,000), unknown (frequency cannot be estimated based on available data).

a) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in blood coagulation factor VIII occurred post-operatively (10th - 14th post-surgery day) in a continuous ADVATE infusion patient.
Clotting was maintained throughout and both factor VIII levels in plasma and the clearance rate returned to adequate levels on the 15th day post-surgery.
Upon completion of the continuous infusion, tests for factor VIII inhibitors were conducted and negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor Development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient exhibited a low inhibitor titer (2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
In addition, no FVIII inhibitor has been detected in any of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors of factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titer (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The frequency of detection of FVIII inhibitors to date is in line with expectations and in the range observed.
Patients "immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by assessing antibody titers to these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
3 of the 182 treated patients who tested for antibodies to CHO-cell protein exhibited a statistically significant uptrend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients had sustained peaks or transient spikes.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms suggesting allergic reaction or hypersensitivity occurred.
Of the 182 treated subjects who tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 exhibited a statistically significant uptrend in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients had a sustained peak or transient peak.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to murine IgG.
Sporadic occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes was reported in four patients during multiple repeated product exposures during the study.
As for other intravenous products, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency unknown) have been reported in ADVATE.
symptoms of overdose with human recombinant blood clotting factor VIII are unknown.
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (Factor VIII and von Willebrand Factor) with differing physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant blood coagulation factor VIII (Octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 280 kD.
When octocog alfa is injected into a haemophilia A patient, it binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor in the blood stream.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clotting can occur.
Haemophilia A is a gender inherited blood clotting disorder due to decreased Factor VIII-levels.
This results in severe bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgery trauma.
The factor VIII-plasma levels are increased by the substitution therapy, whereby a transient correction of factor VIII-deficiency and the tendency to bleed occurs.
All pharmacokinetic trials of ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
Plasma samples were evaluated in a central laboratory using a one-step clotting test.
The pharmacokinetic parameters are from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or <unk> 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below.

As for other intravenous products, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency unknown) have been reported in ADVATE.
symptoms of overdose with human recombinant blood clotting factor VIII are unknown.
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and von Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions.
ADVATE contains recombinant blood coagulation factor VIII (Octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to that found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 280 kD.
When octocog alfa is injected into a haemophilia A patient, it binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor in the blood stream.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clotting can occur.
Haemophilia A is a gender inherited blood clotting disorder due to decreased Factor VIII-levels.
This results in severe bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgery trauma.
The factor VIII-plasma levels are increased by the substitution therapy, whereby a transient correction of factor VIII-deficiency and the tendency to bleed occurs.
All pharmacokinetic trials of ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
Plasma samples were evaluated in a central laboratory using a one-step clotting test.
The pharmacokinetic parameters are from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or <unk> 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below.

After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free of foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3.
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be conducted under the supervision of a physician familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the seriousness of Factor VIII deficiency, on the site and extent of the haemorrhage and on the clinical condition of the patient.
Needs Treatment The Factor VIII dose is given in International Units (IU) in line with the WHO standard for Factor VIII products.
Factor VIII-activity in plasma is presented either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
One IU of factor VIII-activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in a ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required Factor VIII dose is based on empirical evidence that 1 IU of Factor VIII per kg bodyweight increases Factor VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII increase (%) x 0.5
Following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII-activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or IU/ dl) during the corresponding period.
The following table 1 indicates the dosage for haemorrhage and surgery:
Table 1: Dosage regimen for haemorrhage events and surgery Grade of haemorrhage / type of surgery Haemorrhage
Required factor VIII- plasma level (% or IU/ dl)
frequency of dosage (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
Early joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or mouth bleeding.
injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours for patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until indicated bleeding is stopped by pain or healing is achieved.
Increased joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or haematoma.
injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours for patients under 6 years of age) for 3-4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment is resolved.
injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours for patients under 6 years of age) until the risk to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12-24 hours for patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours for patients under 6 years of age) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity of 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted to reflect the clinical efficacy of the product in each case.
In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate Factor VIII plasma levels are advised in order to control the dose and frequency of injections.
Especially for major surgery, close monitoring of substitution therapy by determination of factor VIII-activity in plasma is imperative.
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII, may achieve different in vivo recovery and may have different half-lives.
25 Prophylaxis Doses between 20 and 40 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight should be administered 2-3 days apart to prevent long term bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A
In patients under 6 years of age, doses between 20 and 50 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 3 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored on a regular basis for the formation of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII-plasma activities are not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitors, Factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures may need to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in treating patients with haemophilia. See section 4.4.
method of administration ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate prior training is necessary.
The rate of administration should vary with the patient and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml/ min should not be exceeded.
In the interests of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, note down the name and batch number of the product.
For information on reconstitution prior to administration, see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be alert to immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction, such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory discomfort (e. g. chest tightness, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should discontinue treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
In the case of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be based on current medical standards (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A
These inhibitors are always anti-procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins quantified in Bethesda units (BU) per ml of plasma by a modified Bethesda assay.
Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors may experience an inadequate clinical response.
In such cases, contact a haemophilia centre is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the highest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and dependent on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 days of exposure and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (low-titer) inhibitors has been observed after transfer from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with blood clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for developmental inhibitors. See section 4.8.
This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial after reconstitution.
This must be considered for patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
No interaction studies of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been conducted.
Reproduction studies in animals have not been performed with factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, no experience exists with the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding.
Therefore, in pregnancy and breast-feeding, factor VIII should only be used if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
As with any intravenous protein, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions may occur (see section 4.4).
A total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 out of 234 once treated patients during clinical trials of ADVATE.
The ADRs that occurred in the largest number of patients were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of whom occurred in previously untreated patients at higher risk of forming inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Out of a total of 56 adverse reactions, no were observed in newborns, 16 were reported in 13/ 32 infants, 7 in 4/ 56 children, 8 in 4/ 31 adolescents and 25 in 14/ 94 adults 5.
Frequency categories are defined by the following criteria: Very common (1/ 10), common (1/ 100 to 1/ 10), uncommon (1/ 1,000 to 1/ 100), rare (1/ 10,000 to 1/ 1,000), very rare <unk> 1/ 10,000), unknown (frequency cannot be estimated based on available data).
Within the frequencies, undesirable effects are listed in descending order of severity.
The following table 2 shows the frequency of undesirable effects in clinical trials:

a) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in blood coagulation factor VIII occurred post-operatively (10th - 14th post-surgery day) in a continuous ADVATE infusion patient.
Clotting was maintained throughout and both factor VIII levels in plasma and the clearance rate returned to adequate levels on the 15th day post-surgery.
Upon completion of the continuous infusion, tests for factor VIII inhibitors were conducted and negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor Development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 paediatric and adult patients 6 with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient exhibited a low inhibitor titer (2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
In addition, no FVIII inhibitor has been detected in any of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors of factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titer (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The frequency of detection of FVIII inhibitors to date is in line with expectations and in the range observed.
Patients "immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by assessing antibody titers to these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
3 of the 182 treated patients who tested for antibodies to CHO-cell protein exhibited a statistically significant uptrend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients had sustained peaks or transient spikes.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms suggesting allergic reaction or hypersensitivity occurred.
Of the 182 treated subjects who tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 exhibited a statistically significant uptrend in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients had a sustained peak or transient peak.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to murine IgG.

A total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 out of 234 once treated patients during clinical trials of ADVATE.
The ADRs that occurred in the largest number of patients were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of whom occurred in previously untreated patients at higher risk of forming inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Out of a total of 56 adverse reactions, no were observed in newborns, 16 were reported in 13/ 32 infants, 7 in 4/ 56 children, 8 in 4/ 31 adolescents and 25 in 14/ 94 adults.
Frequency categories are defined by the following criteria: Very common (1/ 10), common (1/ 100 to 1/ 10), uncommon (1/ 1,000 to 1/ 100), rare (1/ 10,000 to 1/ 1,000), very rare <unk> 1/ 10,000), unknown (frequency cannot be estimated based on available data).

a) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in blood coagulation factor VIII occurred post-operatively (10th - 14th post-surgery day) in a continuous ADVATE infusion patient.
Clotting was maintained throughout and both factor VIII levels in plasma and the clearance rate returned to adequate levels on the 15th day post-surgery.
Upon completion of the continuous infusion, tests for factor VIII inhibitors were conducted and negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor Development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient exhibited a low inhibitor titer (2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
In addition, no FVIII inhibitor has been detected in any of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors of factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titer (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The frequency of detection of FVIII inhibitors to date is in line with expectations and in the range observed.
Patients "immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by assessing antibody titers to these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
3 of the 182 treated patients who tested for antibodies to CHO-cell protein exhibited a statistically significant uptrend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients had sustained peaks or transient spikes.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms suggesting allergic reaction or hypersensitivity occurred.
Of the 182 treated subjects who tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 exhibited a statistically significant uptrend in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients had a sustained peak or transient peak.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to murine IgG.
Sporadic occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes was reported in four patients during multiple repeated product exposures during the study.
As for other intravenous products, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency unknown) have been reported in ADVATE.
symptoms of overdose with human recombinant blood clotting factor VIII are unknown.
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and von Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions.
ADVATE contains recombinant blood coagulation factor VIII (Octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to that found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 280 kD.
When octocog alfa is injected into a haemophilia A patient, it binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor in the blood stream.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clotting can occur.
Haemophilia A is a gender inherited blood clotting disorder due to decreased Factor VIII-levels.
This results in severe bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgery trauma.
The factor VIII-plasma levels are increased by the substitution therapy, whereby a transient correction of factor VIII-deficiency and the tendency to bleed occurs.
All pharmacokinetic trials of ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
Plasma samples were evaluated in a central laboratory using a one-step clotting test.
The pharmacokinetic parameters are from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or <unk> 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below.

After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free of foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3.
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ADVATE contains no pharmacologically active amounts of the von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated for the treatment of von Willebrand Jürgen syndrome.
Treatment must be conducted under the supervision of a physician familiar with the treatment of haemophilia.
Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the seriousness of Factor VIII deficiency, on the site and extent of the haemorrhage and on the clinical condition of the patient.
Needs Treatment The Factor VIII dose is given in International Units (IU) in line with the WHO standard for Factor VIII products.
Factor VIII-activity in plasma is presented either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma activity) or in IU (relative to the International Standard for Factor VIII in plasma).
One IU of factor VIII-activity corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in a ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required Factor VIII dose is based on empirical evidence that 1 IU of Factor VIII per kg bodyweight increases Factor VIII activity in plasma by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dose is calculated using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII increase (%) x 0.5
Following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII-activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or IU/ dl) during the corresponding period.
The following table 1 indicates the dosage for haemorrhage and surgery:
Table 1: Dosage regimen for haemorrhage events and surgery Grade of haemorrhage / type of surgery Haemorrhage
Required factor VIII- plasma level (% or IU/ dl)
frequency of dosage (hours) / duration of treatment (days)
Early joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or mouth bleeding.
injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours for patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until indicated bleeding is stopped by pain or healing is achieved.
Increased joint haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage or haematoma.
injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours for patients under 6 years of age) for 3-4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment is resolved.
injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours for patients under 6 years of age) until the risk to the patient is over.
Every 24 hours (12-24 hours for patients under 6 years of age) for at least 1 day until wound healing is achieved.
injection every 8-24 hours (6-24 hours for patients under 6 years of age) until appropriate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity of 30-60% (IU/ dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted to reflect the clinical efficacy of the product in each case.
In some circumstances (e. g. presence of a low inhibitor titer) higher doses than those calculated with the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate Factor VIII plasma levels are advised in order to control the dose and frequency of injections.
Especially for major surgery, close monitoring of substitution therapy by determination of factor VIII-activity in plasma is imperative.
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII, may achieve different in vivo recovery and may have different half-lives.
47 prophylaxis Doses between 20 and 40 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight should be administered 2-3 days apart to prevent long term bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A
In patients under 6 years of age, doses between 20 and 50 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 3 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored on a regular basis for the formation of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII-plasma activities are not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitors, Factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures may need to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in treating patients with haemophilia. See section 4.4.
method of administration ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate prior training is necessary.
The rate of administration should vary with the patient and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml/ min should not be exceeded.
In the interests of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, note down the name and batch number of the product.
For information on reconstitution prior to administration, see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be alert to immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction, such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory discomfort (e. g. chest tightness, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should discontinue treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
In the case of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be based on current medical standards (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A
These inhibitors are always anti-procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins quantified in Bethesda units (BU) per ml of plasma by a modified Bethesda assay.
Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors may experience an inadequate clinical response.
In such cases, contact a haemophilia centre is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the highest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and dependent on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 days of exposure and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (low-titer) inhibitors has been observed after transfer from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with blood clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for developmental inhibitors. See section 4.8.
48 This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial after reconstitution.
This must be considered for patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
No interaction studies of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been conducted.
Reproduction studies in animals have not been performed with factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, no experience exists with the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding.
Therefore, in pregnancy and breast-feeding, factor VIII should only be used if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines.

58 Prophylaxis Doses between 20 and 40 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight should be administered 2-3 days apart to prevent long term bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A
In patients under 6 years of age, doses between 20 and 50 IU of factor VIII per kg bodyweight 3 times weekly is recommended.
Patients should be monitored on a regular basis for the formation of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected Factor VIII-plasma activities are not achieved, or if bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.
In patients with high inhibitors, Factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic measures may need to be considered.
These therapies should only be administered by physicians with experience in treating patients with haemophilia. See section 4.4.
method of administration ADVATE should be administered intravenously.
If it is not to be administered by medical staff, appropriate prior training is necessary.
The rate of administration should vary with the patient and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml/ min should not be exceeded.
In the interests of patients, it is recommended that each time ADVATE is administered, note down the name and batch number of the product.
For information on reconstitution prior to administration, see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins.
As with all intravenous proteins, hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins.
Patients should be alert to immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction, such as rash, itching, generalised urticaria, angioedema, hypotension (e. g. dizziness or syncope), shock and acute respiratory discomfort (e. g. chest tightness, wheezing).
If these symptoms occur, patients should discontinue treatment immediately and contact their doctor.
In the case of anaphylactic shock, shock therapy should be based on current medical standards (see section 4.8).
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A
These inhibitors are always anti-procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins quantified in Bethesda units (BU) per ml of plasma by a modified Bethesda assay.
Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors may experience an inadequate clinical response.
In such cases, contact a haemophilia centre is recommended.
The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the highest risk occurring within the first 20 days of exposure and dependent on genetic and other factors.
In rare cases, inhibitors may form after the first 100 days of exposure.
In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 days of exposure and a history of inhibitor development, recurrence of (low-titer) inhibitors has been observed after transfer from one recombinant factor VIII product to another.
All patients treated with blood clotting factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically and with appropriate laboratory tests for developmental inhibitors. See section 4.8.
After reconstitution, this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
This must be considered for patients on a sodium controlled diet.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
No interaction studies of ADVATE with other medicinal products have been conducted.
Reproduction studies in animals have not been performed with factor VIII.
Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, no experience exists with the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding.
Therefore, in pregnancy and breast-feeding, factor VIII should only be used if there is a clear indication.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
As with any intravenous protein, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions may occur (see section 4.4).
A total of 56 adverse reactions (ADRs) were reported in 27 out of 234 once treated patients during clinical trials of ADVATE.
The ADRs that occurred in the largest number of patients were factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all of whom occurred in previously untreated patients at higher risk of forming inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Out of a total of 56 adverse reactions, no were observed in newborns, 16 were reported in 13/ 32 infants, 7 in 4/ 56 children, 8 in 4/ 31 adolescents and 25 in 14/ 94 adults.
Frequency categories are defined by the following criteria: Very common (1/ 10), common (1/ 100 to 1/ 10), uncommon (1/ 1,000 to 1/ 100), rare (1/ 10,000 to 1/ 1,000), very rare <unk> 1/ 10,000), unknown (frequency cannot be estimated based on available data).
Within the frequencies, undesirable effects are listed in descending order of severity.
The following table 2 shows the frequency of undesirable effects in clinical trials:

a) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in blood coagulation factor VIII occurred post-operatively (10th - 14th post-surgery day) in a continuous ADVATE infusion patient.
Clotting was maintained throughout and both factor VIII levels in plasma and the clearance rate returned to adequate levels on the 15th day post-surgery.
Upon completion of the continuous infusion, tests for factor VIII inhibitors were conducted and negative at the end of the study.
Inhibitor Development The neoantigenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients.
In clinical trials of ADVATE in 145 adult and paediatric patients with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (150 days), only one patient exhibited a low inhibitor titer (2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure to ADVATE.
Subsequent inhibitor tests in this patient after exclusion from the study were negative.
In addition, no FVIII inhibitor has been detected in any of the 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII 2%) after prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (50 days).
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors of factor VIII.
Of these, 4 had a high titer (5 Bethesda units) and 1 a low titer (<unk> 5 Bethesda units).
The frequency of detection of FVIII inhibitors to date is in line with expectations and in the range observed.
Patients "immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by assessing antibody titers to these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.
3 of the 182 treated patients who tested for antibodies to CHO-cell protein exhibited a statistically significant uptrend in titers in linear regression analysis. 4 of these patients had sustained peaks or transient spikes.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms suggesting allergic reaction or hypersensitivity occurred.
Of the 182 treated subjects who tested for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 exhibited a statistically significant uptrend in titers in linear regression analysis. 2 of the patients had a sustained peak or transient peak.
One patient exhibited both a statistically significant uptrend and a sustained peak in antibody levels to murine IgG.
Sporadic occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes was reported in four patients during multiple repeated product exposures during the study.
As for other intravenous products, hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency unknown) have been reported in ADVATE.
symptoms of overdose with human recombinant blood clotting factor VIII are unknown.
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor complex consists of two proteins (factor VIII and von Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions.
ADVATE contains recombinant blood coagulation factor VIII (Octocog alfa), a glycoprotein equivalent to that found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 280 kD.
When octocog alfa is injected into a haemophilia A patient, it binds to the endogenous von Willebrand factor in the blood stream.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
This then releases fibrin from fibrinogen and clotting can occur.
Haemophilia A is a gender inherited blood clotting disorder due to decreased Factor VIII-levels.
This results in severe bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgery trauma.
The factor VIII-plasma levels are increased by the substitution therapy, whereby a transient correction of factor VIII-deficiency and the tendency to bleed occurs.
All pharmacokinetic trials of ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII activity 2%).
Plasma samples were evaluated in a central laboratory using a one-step clotting test.
The pharmacokinetic parameters are from a cross-over study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or <unk> 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below.
Summary of ADVATE pharmacokinetic parameters for 100 patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A (factor VIII <unk> 2%) PK parameters (pharmacokinetics)

if you experience undesirable effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor.
What ADVATE is and what it is used for?
Before you start to use ADVATE, what should you take
WHAT ADVATE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
ADVATE, as active substance, contains octocog alfa, human blood clotting factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology.
Factor VIII is necessary to clot in the blood to stop bleeding.
In patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII-deficiency) it is missing or not working properly.
ADVATE is used to prevent or treat spontaneous haemorrhage or haemorrhage following surgery in patients with haemophilia A.
ADVATE is produced without the addition of a human or animal protein during the cell culture, purification and final formulation process.
BEFORE USE ADVATE, WHAT YOU MUST
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to Octocog alfa or to any of the ingredients
- if you are allergic to mouse or hamster protein.
If in doubt, ask your doctor.
Special caution is required when using ADVATE You should tell your doctor if you have recently been treated with Factor VIII products, especially if you have developed inhibitors.
These inhibitors are neutralising antibodies to factor VIII that reduce the effectiveness of ADVATE in preventing or controlling haemorrhage.
Inhibitors are a known complication of the treatment of haemophilia A.
If your bleeding cannot be controlled with ADVATE, contact your doctor immediately
There is a small possibility that you may develop anaphylactic reaction (sudden, severe, allergic reaction) to ADVATE.
You should be alert to early signs of such
These symptoms may include early signs of anaphylactic shock, which may also include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness and extreme breathing difficulties.
If any of these symptoms occurs, cancel the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe symptoms such as
breathing and (near faintness) need immediate emergency treatment.
If you are taking other medicinal products Please tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken other medicinal products, even if they are non-prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.
Your doctor will decide whether you can use ADVATE in pregnancy and breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines ADVATE has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
Important information about some of the ingredients of ADVATE This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
This must be considered for patients on a sodium restricted diet.
ADVATE treatment is initiated by a physician with experience in the treatment of haemophilia A.
Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or IU) depending on your physical condition and body weight and whether it is used to prevent or treat bleeding.
The frequency depends on how well ADVATE works for you.
Replacement therapy with ADVATE is usually lifelong.
preventing bleeding The usual dose of Octocog alfa is 20 40 IU per kg bodyweight, administered every 2 3 days.
However, in some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may be necessary.
Treatment of haemorrhage Octocog alfa dose is calculated with body weight and desired factor VIII-levels in mind.
The level required varies with the severity and site of the bleeding.
dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII-increase (% of normal) x 0.5
If you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, inform your doctor.
Your doctor will periodically perform appropriate laboratory tests to ensure that you have adequate factor VIII-levels.
This is especially important for major surgery.
Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors If the expected levels of factor VIII in your plasma cannot be achieved or the bleeding cannot be controlled, then factor VIII may be involved in
99 inhibitors and this will be determined by your doctor.
You may need higher doses of ADVATE, or even another product to control the bleeding.
Do not increase the dosage of ADVATE to control your bleeding without asking your doctor.
How ADVATE is administered ADVATE is usually administered by the doctor into a vein (intravenously).
If you or someone else is administering ADVATE, this should only be done after adequate training.
See the Package Leaflet for detailed information on self treatment.
If you have used more ADVATE than you should, always use ADVATE exactly as your doctor has recommended.
Ask your doctor if you are not sure.
If you have used more than this, contact your doctor as soon as possible.
If you forget to use ADVATE Do not inject the double dose if you missed the previous dose.
Continue with the next scheduled dose immediately as instructed by your doctor.
If you stop using ADVATE, do not discontinue use of ADVATE without consulting your doctor.
If you have any questions about the use of this product, contact your doctor.
Like all medicinal products, ADVATE can cause side effects, but not everybody gets them.
If sudden, severe (anaphylactic) side effects occur, the injection must be discontinued immediately. You must contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early symptoms of allergic (hypersensitive) reactions:
- redness, rash, wheezing, itching all over the body,
- difficulty breathing, whistling, tightness in the chest,
Severe adverse reactions including breathlessness, and (near faintness) require immediate emergency treatment.
Very common: affecting more than 1 in 10 patients Common: affects between 1 and 10 in 100 patients Uncommon: affects between 1 and 10 in 1,000 patients Rare: affects between 1 and 10 in 10,000 patients Very rare: affects less than 1 in 10,000 patients Unknown: (frequency cannot be estimated based on available data).

Questions and Answers on the withdrawal of the marketing authorisation application for Advexin
International Freiname (INN): Contusugene Ladenovec
On 17 December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited formally notified the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) that it was withdrawing its application for marketing authorisation for Advexin to treat Li-Fraumeni cancer.
Advexin was designated an orphan medicinal product on 23 October 2006.
Advexin is a suspension for injection containing Contusugenes Ladenovec, a genetically modified virus carrying the p53 gene.
What should Advexin be used for?
Advexin should have been used to treat Li-Fraumeni cancer in patients 18 years of age and over.
Li-Fraumeni Cancer is a type of cancer that affects patients with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome who have a mutation defective gene called p53 and are more likely to get cancer if they have this mutation.
Li-Fraumeni cancer can occur in many parts of the body.
However, it usually affects the chest, brain, bones or soft tissues (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body).
The active substance in Advexin, Contusugene Ladenovec, is a viral vector.
This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.
The virus in Advexin is an adenovirus that has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and therefore does not cause infection in humans.
The gene that carries the virus in Advexin is the normal (not defective) p53 gene.
Advexin should have been injected directly into the tumours, enabling cancer cells to reproduce the normal p53 protein.
The p53 protein, which is made up of the non-defective p53 gene present in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to the killing of cells when DNA cannot be recovered.
Since cancer cells contain damaged DNA, the p53 protein helps to restore DNA or causes cells to die.
In Li-Fraumeni cancer, which has a defective p53 gene, the p53 protein does not function properly and cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.
Advexin should have cured or slowed the progression of the disease by restoring the cells "normal protective function.
What documents has the company presented to the CHMP in support of its application?
The effects of Advexin were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The company presented data from a trial in a patient who had Li-Fraumeni cancer in the abdominal region, in the bone and in the brain.
The patient received 12 advexin injections over five months, which were injected into some of the tumours.

efficacy was assessed by scans looking at how tumours responded to treatment and presented results of several small studies looking at the effects of a dose range of Advexin in various cancer types. At what stage in the assessment was the withdrawal request at?
When the company withdrew its application, day 179 was achieved in the application procedure.
After the CHMP reviewed the company's replies to the questions it received, a number of issues remained unresolved.
It usually takes up to 210 days for the CHMP to assess a new application.
Based on the review of initial submissions, on day 120 the CHMP will draw up a list of questions to be sent to the company.
Once the company has provided answers to these questions, they will be reviewed by the CHMP.
Before the CHMP delivers an opinion, it may ask the company any remaining questions on Day 180.
What was the CHMP recommendation at this stage?
Based on the data reviewed and the company's response to the CHMP list of questions, there were some concerns on the part of CHMP at the time of withdrawal and the Committee took the preliminary view that Advexin could not have been approved for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.
What were the main concerns of the CHMP?
The CHMP believes there is insufficient evidence to show that injection of Advexin into Li-Fraumeni tumours delivers benefits for patients.
The Committee also had concerns about how the product is processed in the body, how it is administered and the safety of the product.
Moreover, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful for the environment or for people who come into close contact with the patient.
On what grounds has the company withdrawn the application?
The letter advising the EMEA on the withdrawal of the application can be found here.
What consequences does the withdrawal have for patients currently participating in clinical trials and / or compassionate-use programmes with Advexin?
The company has not notified the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or compassionate use programmes with Advexin.

Aerinaze is a medicinal product containing the active ingredients desloratadine (2.5 mg) and pseudoephedrine (120 mg).
It is available as blue and white altered drug release tablets. Altered drug release means that the tablets are designed to release one of the active ingredients immediately and the other slowly over a few hours.
Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hayfever, nasal inflammation induced by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal swelling (nasal congestion).
This medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
In adults and adolescents 12 years of age and over, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily is a tablet to be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.
Treatment should be as short as possible and should be discontinued as soon as the symptoms, especially nasal swelling (nasal constipation), resolve.
Duration of treatment of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicinal product on nasal constipation may decrease.
Once the nose is clear, patients can take desloratadine alone.
Aerinaze contains two active ingredients:
desloratadine, an antihistamine, and pseudoephedrine, a nasal decongestant.
Desloratadine blocks the receptors that histamine, an endogenous substance that causes allergic symptoms, usually attaches to.
If the receptors are blocked, histamine is unable to act and this relieves the symptoms of allergy.
Pseudoephedrine stimulates the nerve endings to release the chemical messenger substance noradrenaline, which causes blood vessels to contract (narrow).
As a result, less fluid escapes from the vessels, which reduces swelling and allows the nose to secrete less mucus.
Aerinaze combines two active ingredients because one antihistamine alone often does not provide adequate relief from symptoms in patients with nasal constipation.

Desloratadine is released from its layer immediately after administration, while pseudoephedrine is slowly released for 12 hours. Therefore, the tablet has to be taken only twice daily.
The efficacy of Aerinaze was evaluated in two main studies involving a total of 1,248 adult and adolescent patients.
In both studies, Aerinaze was compared to desloratadine alone and to pseudoephedrine alone.
The main measures of efficacy were changes in the seriousness of hayfever symptoms reported by patients prior to the initiation of treatment and during 15-day treatment.
During the study, patients entered their symptoms in a diary every 12 hours and used a standard scale to assess how severe their symptoms were in the last 12 hours.
What benefit has Aerinaze shown in these trials?
Aerinaze relieved symptoms more effectively than the two agents alone.
When looking at all hayfever symptoms except nose constipation, patients taking Aerinaze reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms compared to 35.9% for pseudoephedrine alone.
When only nasal swelling was considered, patients on Aerinaze experienced a 37.4% relief compared to 26.7% for those taking desloratadine alone.
Similar results were observed in the second study.
The most frequent adverse reactions with Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 in 100 patients) are tachycardia (racing), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), pharyngitis (pharyngitis), anorexia (anorexia), constipation, headache, tiredness, insomnia, somnolence (somnolence), trouble sleeping and nervousness.
For a full list of side effects reported with Aerinaze, see the Package Leaflet.
Do not use Aerinaze in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or to any of the ingredients, to adrenergic agents or loratadine (another allergic medicinal product).
It must not be used in patients who are taking or have stopped taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (such as some antidepressant medicinal products) within the last two weeks.
Nor should Aerinaze be used in patients with narrow angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), urinary retention (difficult urination), cardiovascular disorders including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (thyroid hypersecretion), or who have had a haemorrhagic stroke (stroke caused by cerebral haemorrhage) or are at risk of a haemorrhagic stroke.
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Aerinaze in treating seasonal allergic rhinitis with nasal swelling outweigh the risks and recommended that Aerinaze be authorised to be marketed.
On 30 July 2007, the European Commission authorised SP Europe to market Aerinaze throughout the European Union.

For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Oval tablet with a blue and a white layer, the blue layer is engraved with D12.
Treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis with associated nasal swelling.
Adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over:
The recommended dose of Aerinaze is one tablet twice daily.
The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but must be swallowed whole (i. e. without biting, breaking or chewing).
They can be taken regardless of meals.
Due to the lack of safety and efficacy data (see section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.
The duration of administration should be as short as possible and should not be continued after symptoms subside.
It is recommended that the duration of administration is limited to 10 days, as long-term use may reduce the activity of pseudoephedrine over time.
Following decreased mucosal swelling in the upper respiratory tract, treatment with desloratadine as monotherapy may be continued as necessary.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients, adrenergic agents or loratadin.
Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, it is also contraindicated for patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO/ inhibitor) and within the 2 weeks after discontinuation of such therapy.
Aerinaze is also contraindicated for patients with:
2
Cardiovascular disorders such as ischaemic heart disease, tachyarrhythmia and severe hypertension, hyperthyroidism, a history of haemorrhagic stroke or risk factors that may increase the risk of having a haemorrhagic stroke. This is due to alphamimetic activity associated with combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolide, lisuride, cabergolin, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or other decongestants used perorally or nasally as a decongestant (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazolin, naphazolin, etc.).
The recommended dosage and duration of treatment must not be exceeded (see section 4.2).
Patients over 60 years of age are more likely to experience adverse events with sympathomimetics such as pseudoephedrine.
The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been evaluated for this population and data are insufficient to recommend appropriate dosing regimens.
Caution should therefore be exercised when using the combination in patients over 60 years of age.
The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze have not been evaluated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and data are insufficient to recommend appropriate dosage.
The combination preparation is not recommended for use in patients with impaired renal or hepatic impairment.
Do not use Aerinaze in children under 12 years of age (see section 4.2).
Patients should be advised that treatment should be discontinued if hypertension or tachycardia occur or if palpitations, cardiac dysrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or headache aggravation) occur.
Sympathomimetic amines may cause central nervous system stimulation with seizure or cardiovascular collapse with hypotension.
These effects are more likely in paediatric, elderly patients or in the case of overdose (see section 4.9).
Caution should be exercised when treating the following populations: Digitalis patients with cardiac dysrhythmia Patients with hypertension Patients with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, bladder obstruction or bronchospasm.
Caution should be used in patients with stenosising stomach ulcers and pyloroduodenal obstruction.
Caution should also be exercised in patients treated with other sympathomimetics.
These include: decongestants Anorectics or psychostimulants amphetamine type 3 Antihypertensives Tricyclic antidepressants and other antihistamines.
Moreover, caution should be exercised in patients with migraine who are treated concomitantly with vasoconstricting ergotalkaloids.
Continuous use may lead to a tolerance that increases the risk of overdose.
Use of volatile halogenated anaesthetics during therapy with indirect sympathomimetics may lead to perioperative acute hypertension.
Therefore, in the case of surgery, it is preferable to discontinue treatment 24 hours prior to the anaesthesia.
Athletes should be advised that pseudoephedrine therapy may result in positive doping tests.
Aerinaze should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to dermatological tests as antihistamines may otherwise prevent or reduce the extent of positive reactions to indicators of skin reaction.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
However, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in plasma concentration of desloratadine were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine for which erythromycin or ketoconazole were added.
Reversible and irreversible MAOI may increase the risk of vascular narrowing and hypertension.
Co-administration of sympathomimetics may lead to critical hypertonic reactions.
The following concomitant therapies are not recommended: bromocriptine Cabergolin Lisuride, pergolide: risk for the occurrence of vascular narrowing and hypertension.
Dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergometrine: risk for vascular narrowing and hypertension.
Other vasoconstricting agents used orally or nasally as decongestant rhinologic agents (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin, etc.):
Sympathomimetics may reduce the antihypertensive effect of -methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine, veratrum alkaloids and guanethidine.
The rate of absorption of pseudoephedrine sulphate is increased by antacids and decreased by kaolin.
The interaction between Aerinaze and alcohol has not been investigated.
In a clinical pharmacological trial, concomitant administration of desloratadine and alcohol increased
no significant differences could be detected between patients treated with desloratadine and those treated with placebo, whether desloratadine was administered alone or with alcohol.
The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not yet been identified and interactions with other medicinal products cannot be excluded.
Desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.
In animal studies, neither desloratadine nor the combination of loratadine and pseudoephedrine was teratogenic.
The safety of use of Aerinaze during pregnancy has not been established, but experience in a large number of affected pregnancies has not revealed an increase in the frequency of malformations compared to the incidence in the normal population.
Since reproduction studies in animals cannot always be transmitted to humans, and due to the vasoconstrictory characteristics of pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.
Desloratadine and pseudoephedrine are released into human milk.
Decreased milk production has been reported in nursing mothers in connection with pseudoephedrine.
Therefore, Aerinaze should not be used while breast-feeding.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies have been carried out on the effect of Aerinaze on ability to drive and use machines.
In clinical trials to assess ability to drive, no impairment was detected in patients receiving desloratadine.
However, patients should be advised that in very rare cases light-headedness may occur, which may result in impairment of ability to drive or use machines.
Pseudoephedrine sulphate is not expected to affect psychomotor function.
In clinical trials of 414 adults, the most common adverse events observed were insomnia (8.9%), dry mouth (7.2%) and headache (3.1%).
These and other adverse events that occurred in clinical trials are listed in the table below.
