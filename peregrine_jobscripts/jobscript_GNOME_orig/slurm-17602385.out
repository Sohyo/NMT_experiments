For example, if a message declares the Resent-From: header as UNKNOWNTOKENINREF engineering @ example.com UNKNOWNTOKENINREF and then restates it as UNKNOWNTOKENINREF marketing @ example.com UNKNOWNTOKENINREF, Evolution filters as though the second declaration did not occur. To filter on messages that use headers multiple times, use a regular expression.
