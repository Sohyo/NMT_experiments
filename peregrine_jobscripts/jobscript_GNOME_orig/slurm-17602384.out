Use regular expressions to filter messages that define the same headers more than once.
2021-01-23 15:37:40 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: If a message uses a header more than once, Evolution pays attention only to the first instance, even if the message defines the header differently the second time. For example, if a message declares the Resent-From: header as UNKNOWNTOKENINREF engineering @ example.com UNKNOWNTOKENINREF and then restates it as UNKNOWNTOKENINREF marketing @ example.com UNKNOWNTOKENINREF, Evolution filters as though the second declaration did not occur. To filter on messages that use headers multiple times, use a regular expression.
