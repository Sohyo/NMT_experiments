Not all archive types support integrity checks. The following archive types can be checked for integrity: 7-Zip, RAR, ZIP, ACE, ARJ, and Zoo.
To check the integrity of an archive whose format does not support integrity checks, uncompress all files from the archive and check if this action has been successful.

Of the editing tools in F-Spot, color matching is probably the most powerful tool. Color matching allows you to:
This simulates the extension or shortening of the exposure time.
This setting allows you to adjust the color intensity in a picture. Moving to the left reduces the colors all the way to the black and white image, while moving to the right intensifies the colors.
This setting increases the brightness of colors. A value too high will make colors look washed out, while a value too low will make the image too dark and low in contrast.
This setting lets colors rotate along the color wheel <unk>.
This setting adjusts the contrast ratio, so the difference between the bright and dark pixels. Moving to the left reduces the contrast while moving to the right increases the contrast.
This setting changes the color temperature, measured in Kelvin.
This setting allows you to hue your photos using a color.

To start a new game, perform the following steps:
Click one of the buttons in the toolbar.
Starts a new game with all available variants.
Starts a new game that only contains logic puzzles.
Starts a new game containing only arithmetical exercises.
Starts a new game that consists only of memory exercises.
Starts a new game that contains only verbal analogies.
Always read the instructions carefully when you play a game!
The game session starts by displaying the problem and asking for the answer. At the bottom of the window are the main controls used to control the game.

It includes several variants, including logic puzzles, headers, memory exercises, and verbal analogies designed to test different cognitive abilities.
<unk> If you answer a task incorrectly, you won <unk> t score points.
If you answer a task correctly, you will score points depending both on the time it took to solve the problem and on whether a hint was consulted during play.
The following table summarizes the different playing times (in seconds) depending on the difficulty level.
Based on the expected time for the selected level of difficulty and the time needed for the exercise, the following logic is used:
If you are faster than the expected time, you score 10 points.
If you are slower than expected, you will score 8 points.
If you take more than twice as long as the expected time, you score 7 points.
If you take more than three times as long as the expected time, you score 6 points.
If you use a hint, you get only 80% of the original result.
This means that if you have medium difficulty, you need to score 10 points in at least 20 games of each type to get 100 points.
This may sound challenging, but it allows players to compare results from different sessions in the game history and better track the player's progress in all completed tasks.
Use the different check boxes below the image to select the results to be displayed in the image.
To change the number of saved game sessions or how many games will be stored in the history, proceed as follows:
<unk> Use the first settings box to change the number of play sessions that need to be saved so that the results appear for the first time in the history graph.
The second control pane is used to change the number of play sessions shown in the history graph.
To change the difficulty of a game, proceed as follows:
Use the clues to solve a puzzle.
Some games offer simple hints that can be useful in solving the problem.
This feature is not available for some games.
To pause a game so that you can resume it at a later point, perform one of the following steps:
To continue play after it has been paused, perform one of the following steps:
To exit a game, perform the following steps:

Tasks that challenge your reasoning and thinking. These puzzles are based on sequences of elements, visual and spatial conclusions, or connections between elements.
Tasks based on arithmetic operations to improve your brain computing skills. In these exercises, the player has to combine multiplication, division, addition and subtraction and use them in different ways.
Tasks that test your short term memory. These exercises are collections of items that the player should memorize. Sometimes they are connections between elements, words, numbers, or colors.
Games that require your verbal dexterity. These tasks ask the player to find causes and effects, use synonyms or opposites, and check the vocabulary.
To achieve this, proceed as follows:
