To view a file from an archive
It might be impossible to remove a corrupted file, resulting in data loss. For this reason, you should check the integrity of the archive before deleting the original files.
Not all types of archives support integrity testing. The following types of archives can be integrity tested: 7-Zip, RAR, ZIP, ACE, ARJ, and Zoo.
To check the integrity of an archive whose format does not support integrity checks, uncompress all files from the archive and check that this operation was successful.

The way from the original position to the target position must be free, so you cannot leap over other items.
A straight horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of five or more items will be removed from the Tableau. In this case, you will also be dealt an additional move where no items are added to the Tableau.
The game is over when the Tableau is full because no object can be moved.
You score points by forming rows of five or more items. The recoverable points depend on the number of items removed.
Try to bring at least three identical items into a line with each move.
Try to put together more than five items. With six items, for example, you can form two rows with two or three items, with an empty space between them. On the next turn, insert the sixth item.

To change the number of seconds available to memorize a memory task, perform the following procedure:

To start a new game, perform the following steps:
Click one of the buttons in the toolbar.
Starts a new game with all available variants.
Starts a new game that requires only logic.
Starts a new game that only contains arithmetical exercises.
Starts a new game consisting only of memory exercises.
Starts a new game that contains only verbal analogies.
Always read the instructions carefully when you play a game!
The game session starts by displaying the problem and asking for the answer. At the bottom of the window are the main controls controlling the game.
<unk> image: <unk> figures <unk> gbrainy.png <unk>; md5 <unk> d3b523ab1c8d00d00560d3f036d681bb
It includes different kinds of logic puzzles, brain arithmetic, memory exercises, and verbal analogies that are designed to test different cognitive abilities.
If you incorrectly answer a task, you receive no points.
If you complete a task correctly, you will receive points that depend both on the time it took to solve the problem and on whether a hint was consulted during play.
The following table summarizes the different play times (in seconds) depending on the difficulty level.
Based on the expected time for the selected difficulty and the time taken to complete the exercise, the following logic is used:
If you are faster than the expected time, you score 10 points.
If you are slower than expected, you score 8 points.
If you take more than twice the expected time, you score 7 points.
If you take more than three times the expected time, you score 6 points.
If you use a hint, you will only get 80% of the original result.
With an intermediate level of difficulty, you need to score 10 points in at least 20 games of each type to have a 100 point end result.
This might sound challenging, but it allows players to compare results from different sessions in the game history and track the player <unk> s progress with each task completed.
Use the different check boxes below the graph to select the results to display in the graph.
To change the number of saved game sessions or how many games will be saved in the history, perform the following procedure:
Use the first controls to change the number of play sessions that need to be saved so that the results are shown for the first time in the history graph.
The second control pane lets you change the number of play sessions shown in the history graph.
To change the difficulty of a game, perform the following procedure:
Use the clues to solve a puzzle.
In some games, simple hints are offered that can be useful in solving the problem.
This feature is not available in some games.
To stop a game so that you can resume it at a later point, perform one of the following steps:
To continue a game after it is paused, perform one of the following steps:
To close a game, perform the following procedure:

tasks that challenge your reasoning and thinking. These puzzles are based on sequences of elements, visual and spatial conclusions, or relationships between elements.
tasks that are based on arithmetical operations to improve your mental arithmetic. The player has to combine multiplication, division, addition and subtraction and use them in different ways.
tasks that test your short term memory. These exercises are collections of items that the player should memorize. Sometimes they are connections between elements, words, numbers or colors.
games that test your verbal prowess. These tasks ask the player to find the causes and effects, use synonyms or opposites, and check the vocabulary.
To achieve this, perform the following procedure:
