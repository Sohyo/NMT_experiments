Seeking to facilitate tourism and cultural exchanges between the Parties,
The Convention on the International Carriage of Passengers by Bus and Coach (ASOR), signed in Dublin on 26 May 1982, contains no provisions for the accession of other Parties.
The experience gained from the above Convention and the liberalisation achieved should be preserved.
It is desirable to ensure harmonised liberalisation of certain occasional cross-border bus and coach services and related transit services.
It is desirable to provide for certain harmonised procedural rules for non-liberalised occasional cross-border traffic, which remains subject to authorisation.
In the interests of road safety and environmental protection, it is necessary to provide for extensive harmonisation of the technical requirements imposed on vehicles used in occasional international bus and coach transport between the Parties.
It is necessary that the Contracting Parties apply uniform rules concerning the work of bus and coach drivers engaged in international road transport.
It is desirable to harmonise conditions for access to the road transport industry,
The principle of non-discrimination based on the nationality or place of business of the carrier and the country of origin or destination of the bus and coach must be regarded as a basic requirement for the provision of cross-border transport services.
In order to facilitate and simplify control procedures, it is necessary to provide for uniform models for accompanying documents such as the control document for liberalised occasional transport and the authorisation and application form for non-liberalised transport.
In order to enforce this Convention, certain harmonised measures shall be provided for, in particular as regards control procedures, penal provisions and mutual assistance.

in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Community and the Republic of Croatia on the ecopoint system applicable as from 1 January 2003 to transit traffic between the Republic of Croatia and Austria
I am pleased to inform you that following negotiations between the Delegation of the Republic of Croatia and the Delegation of the European Community, in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 (2) (b) of Protocol No 6 to the Interim Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Croatia, the following has been agreed:
1. Ecopoints (transit rights) for Croatian lorries transiting through Austria for 2003: 171904 ecopoints.
Additional ecopoints for Croatian users of <unk> Rolling Road (RoLa) (up to a maximum of 40% of the total number of ecopoints for 2003): 68762 ecopoints.
Ecopoints for users of the RoLa shall be allocated to the Croatian authorities in the form of two RoLa ecopoints for two road trips each.
Austrian Combined Transport Companies shall notify the Ministry of Maritime, Transport and Communications of the Republic of Croatia monthly of the number of Croatian users of combined transport transiting Austria.
Transit journeys carried out under the conditions specified in Annex A or on the basis of CBMT authorisation shall be excluded from the ecopoint system.
2. The driver of a Croatian lorry shall carry the following on Austrian territory and, upon request, submit them for inspection to the supervisory authorities, either:
( a) a duly completed standard form or Austrian certificate confirming payment of ecopoints for the journey in question (see Annex B), hereinafter referred to as <unk> ecokarte <unk>, or
( b) an electronic device attached to the vehicle enabling the automatic debiting of ecopoints, hereinafter referred to as <unk> environmental data carrier <unk> (<unk> ecotag <unk>), or
( c) appropriate documentation proving that an ecopoint-free transit trip pursuant to Annex A or with a CBMT permit is concerned; or
( d) appropriate documentation proving that it is not a transit journey and that the environmental data carrier, where present on the vehicle, is properly set up.
The competent Austrian authorities issue the eco-card against payment of the costs of production and distribution of ecopoints and eco-cards.
3. Environmental data carriers shall be manufactured, programmed and attached in accordance with the general technical specifications set out in Annex C. The Ministry of Maritime, Transport and Communications of the Republic of Croatia shall be authorised to approve, programme and install environmental data carriers.
The environmental data carrier shall contain information on the country of origin and NOx emissions of the vehicle, in accordance with the indications in the COP certificate (Conformity of Production), on the conformity of current production in accordance with point 4.
The environmental data carrier shall be attached to the windscreen of the vehicle.
Its position corresponds to Annex D. It is not transferable.
4. The driver of a Croatian lorry registered on or after 1 October 1990 shall also have a COP certificate in accordance with Annex E for the verification of the NOx emissions of that vehicle and shall provide such certificates upon request.
For heavy goods vehicles registered before 1 October 1990 or for which no documentation is available, a COP value of 15.8 g/ kWh shall be applied.
5. The Ministry of Maritime, Transport and Communications of the Republic of Croatia shall be entitled to issue documents and environmental data carriers referred to in paragraphs 2 to 4 above.
6. If the vehicle does not use an environmental data carrier, the necessary ecopoints shall be attached to the eco-map and validated.
The eco-map shall be validated as follows:
( a) by stamping the eco-card in an eco-card stamping machine;
b) by stamping the eco-card by the Austrian border control upon entry into Austria;
( c) by stamping and dating the eco-map by the national authorities of the road haulier prior to entry into Austrian territory;
( d) by stamping the eco-map by a body carrying out the initial activation of environmental data carriers.
The Austrian border crossing points equipped with an ecocard stamping machine are listed in Annex F.
For statistical purposes, page 1 of the completed eco-map shall either be collected by the Austrian authorities or returned by the competent authorities to the Austrian authorities within three months of the end of the journey.
The statistical data collected thereby will be used by the Commission for proposals on the allocation of the reserve of ecopoints.
If the vehicle is equipped with an environmental data carrier, a number of ecopoints corresponding to the information stored on the environmental data carrier concerning the vehicle's NOx emissions shall be deducted from the total ecopoints allocated to the Republic of Croatia during an ecopoint transit.
This will be implemented through an infrastructure provided and operated by the Austrian authorities.
In the case of vehicles with environmental data carriers, bilateral journeys of the environmental data carriers must be made before driving on Austrian territory in such a way that it is possible to prove that this is not a transit journey.
If an eco-card is used and a tractor is replaced during a transit journey, the confirmation of payment issued upon entry shall remain valid and stored.
If the COP value of the new tractor exceeds the value indicated on the form, additional ecopoints on a new card will be invalidated upon departure.
7. Continuous journeys which involve the one-time crossing of the Austrian border by rail - whether in conventional rail transport or combined transport - and the crossing by road before or after crossing the Austrian border by rail shall not be regarded as road freight transit through Austria, but as bilateral journeys.
Bilateral journeys are continuous transit journeys through Austria using the following railway terminals:
Fürnitz, Villach Süd, Sillian, Innsbruck/ Hall, Brennersee, Graz.
8. Ecopoints shall be valid from 1 January of the year for which they were awarded until 31 January of the following year.
9. Violations of this Agreement by the driver of a Croatian lorry or undertaking shall be sanctioned in accordance with applicable national legislation.
The Commission and the competent Austrian and Croatian authorities shall, within their competence, assist each other in the investigation and prosecution of these infringements, in particular ensuring that ecomaps and environmental data carriers are used and handled correctly.
Controls may be carried out at the discretion of the Member State of the European Community at a location other than the internal border, provided that the principle of non-discrimination is not infringed.
10. Austrian supervisory authorities may, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, take appropriate measures where a vehicle is equipped with an environmental data carrier and at least one of the following facts exists:
( a) repeated infringements caused by vehicles or committed by the vehicle operator;
( b) there are no longer sufficient ecopoints for Croatia;
( c) the environmental data medium has been manipulated or exchanged by a party other than the party authorised under paragraph 3;
( d) Croatia has not allocated sufficient ecopoints to the vehicle for transit;
( e) the vehicle does not have appropriate documentation pursuant to paragraph 2 (c) or (d) to prove that the setting up of the environmental data medium according to which the voyage in question is not regarded as a transit voyage on Austrian territory is permissible;
( f) the environmental data medium described in Annex C is not equipped with sufficient ecopoints for transit.
Austrian supervisory authorities may, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, take appropriate measures where a vehicle is not equipped with an environmental data carrier and at least one of the following circumstances exists:
( a) no eco-map shall be submitted to supervisory authorities in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement;
( b) an eco-map shall be presented which is incomplete or incorrect or on which the ecopoints are incorrectly applied;
( c) the vehicle does not have the relevant documentation to prove that it does not need ecopoints, or
( d) the eco-card has not been validated in accordance with the procedure referred to in paragraph 6.
11. Printed ecopoints intended to be affixed to eco-maps shall be made available annually before 1 November of the previous year.
12. For vehicles registered before 1 October 1990 and whose engines have since been replaced, the COP value of the new engine shall apply.
In this case, the certificate issued by the competent authority shall contain a notice of engine replacement and specify the new COP value for NOx emissions.
13. A transit journey shall be exempted from payment with ecopoints if the following three conditions apply:
( a) the sole purpose of the journey is the transfer of a brand new vehicle or combination of vehicles from the manufacturer to the destination in another State;
( b) no goods shall be transported;
( c) the vehicle or combination of vehicles shall have relevant international registration documents and export registration plates.
14. A transit journey shall be exempted from the payment of ecopoints if it concerns the unladen section of a journey for which no ecopoints are payable pursuant to Annex A and appropriate documentation shall be taken to prove this.
( a) a waybill or
( b) a completed eco-map on which no ecopoints have been attached, or
( c) a completed eco-card with ecopoints that can be reused later.
15. Any problems relating to the management of this ecopoint system shall be submitted to the Interim Subcommittee on Transport between the Community and the Republic of Croatia established pursuant to Article 41 of the Interim Agreement; the Committee shall evaluate the situation and recommend appropriate measures.
All measures to be taken shall be implemented immediately in accordance with the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination.

The requested State shall make every effort to treat a request and its content confidentially if the requesting State requests such confidentiality.
