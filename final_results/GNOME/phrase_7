To view a file from an archive
It might be impossible to decompress a corrupted file, leading to data loss. Therefore, you should check the integrity of the archive before deleting the original files.
Not all archive types support integrity checks. The following archive types can be tested for integrity: 7-Zip, RAR, ZIP, ACE, ARJ, and Zoo.
To check the integrity of an archive whose format does not support integrity checks, uncompress all files from the archive and check that this action has been successful.

The path from the original position to the target position must be clear, which means you cannot jump over other objects.
A straight horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of five or more items will be removed from the tableau. In this case, you will also be dealt an additional move where no additional items will be added to the tableau.
The game is over when the tableau is full, as then no object can be moved.
You score points by forming rows of five or more items; the number of items you can score depends on the number of items you remove.
Try to place at least three of the same objects in a line with each turn.
Try to put more than five items together. For example, with six items, you can make two consecutive lines with two or three items and a blank in between. On the next turn, insert the sixth item.

A brief introduction to the possibilities of marking with F-Spot
There are several ways to search for tags.
First method: Double click on the tags you want to search for.
Drag the tags you want to search for in the search box that you just checked.
To exclude a marker from your search:
Double click the marker you want to exclude in the toolbar. This will first add it to the search bar.
Then double-click the marker you want to exclude in the search bar.
As with adding tags, there are two basic methods to remove tags from your photos.
Select the photos you want to remove a marker from.
Select a marker in the marker pane that you want to remove from the photos you select.
Right click on the photos.
Deleting tags completely removes them from the system, but leaves the photos to which this tag is associated.
Select the marker to remove from the marker pane.
create tags that can be associated with photos
To use tags at all, you first need to create a set of tags. There are three basic methods for creating tags.
Select the photos you want to assign the new marker to.
Select photos you want to tag.
Select a marker in the marker pane that you want to add to the selected photos.
Rate your photos with one to five stars
Double click on the photo you want to rate.
In the lower right corner, you will see five points related to the score to be awarded. For example, to award a star, click on the first point.
Select the photo (s) for rating.
Right click on the photo (s) to be rated and select a rating at the bottom of the context menu by clicking the appropriate item.
To search for photos by rating stars:
Select the range of ratings for the photos you want to view.
To stop searching for rating stars:

Alternatively, you can use the timeline:

This mode removes the colors, converting a colored image to a black and white image.
This mode simulates a photo taken with sepia tint.
This mode automatically synchronizes the colors with a set profile.
Of the editing tools in F-Spot, color matching is probably the most powerful tool. Color matching allows you to:
This simulates lengthening or shortening the exposure time.
This setting allows you to adjust the color intensity in a picture. Moving to the left reduces the colors down to black and white, while moving to the right intensifies the colors.
This setting increases the brightness of the colors; a value that is too high will make colors look washed out, while a value that is too low will make the image too dark and low in contrast.
This setting lets colors rotate along the color wheel.
This adjusts the contrast ratio, i.e. the difference between light and dark pixels. Moving to the left reduces contrast, while moving to the right increases contrast.
This setting changes the color temperature measured in Kelvin.
This setting allows you to tint your photos with one color.
Convert to monochrome with controls. Requires Mono 2.2.
This extension allows you to burn your photos to a CD.
This extension allows you to export your photos to Flickr and 23hq.
This extension allows you to export your photos as HTML galleries, original galleries, or to a folder.
This extension allows you to export your photos to a PHP gallery (https: / / gallery.menalto.com).
This extension allows you to export your photos to PicasaWeb.
This extension allows you to export your photos to SmugMug.
This extension allows you to export your photos to Tabblo.
NOT STABLE - Please make sure you create a backup of photos.db before testing this extension. This extension allows you to change the base path of your photos. It is very convenient, for example, to move your photos from <unk> / Photos to / OurPhotos. Just make sure that SqLite can implement the changes for a few hours after f-spot has finished. Only the path to your photos in the Photos folder will be changed.

Changing the time available for memory tasks
To change the number of seconds available to memorize a memory task, proceed as follows:

To start a new game, perform the following steps:
Click one of the toolbar buttons.
Starts a new game with all available variants.
Starts a new logic puzzle game.
Starts a new game that only contains arithmetic exercises.
Starts a new game consisting only of memory exercises.
Starts a new game that contains only verbal analogies.
Always read the instructions carefully when playing a game!
The game session starts by displaying the problem and asking for the answer. At the bottom of the window you will find the main controls for controlling the game.

It includes various variations, including logic puzzles, brain arithmetic, memory exercises, and verbal analogies designed to test various cognitive abilities.
If you answer a task incorrectly, you will receive no points.
If you answer a task correctly, you will score points that depend both on the time it took to solve the problem and on whether a clue has been consulted during play.
The following table summarizes the different playing times (in seconds) depending on the difficulty.
Based on the time expected for the selected difficulty and the time taken for the exercise, the following logic is used:
If you are faster than expected, you will score 10 points.
If you are slower than expected, you will score 8 points.
If you take more than twice as long as the expected time, you score 7 points.
If you take more than three times the expected time, you score 6 points.
If you use a hint, you will only get 80% of the original result.
This means that if you have medium difficulty, you need to score 10 points in at least 20 games of each type to get 100 points.
This may sound demanding, but it allows players to compare results from different sessions in the game history and better track the progress of the player in all completed tasks.
Use the various check boxes below the graph to select the results you want to display in the graph.
To change the number of saved sessions or how many games are stored in the history, proceed as follows:
Use the first settings box to change the number of sessions that need to be saved so that the results are displayed in the history graph for the first time.
The second control panel is used to change the number of sessions shown in the history graph.
To change the difficulty of a game, proceed as follows:
Use the clues to solve a puzzle.
Some games offer simple hints that can be helpful in solving the problem.
This feature is not available for some games.
To pause a game so that you can resume it at a later point, perform one of the following steps:
To resume play after it has been paused, perform one of the following steps:

tasks that challenge your reasoning and reasoning. These puzzles are based on sequences of elements, visual and spatial reasoning, or connections between elements.
tasks based on arithmetic operations to improve your brain arithmetic skills. In these exercises, the player has to combine multiplication, division, addition and subtraction and use them in different ways.
tasks that test your short term memory. These exercises are collections of items that the player should memorize. Sometimes they are connections between elements, words, numbers, or colors.
